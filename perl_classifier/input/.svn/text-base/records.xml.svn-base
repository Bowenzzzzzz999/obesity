The patient gives a several month history of left anterior chest and throat "burning and tightness," occurring with exertion, associated with mild shortness of breath and improving with rest after approximately five minutes.  A SPECT-thallium performed on June 11, 2002 revealed no evidence of frank ischemia.  Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58%.  He has had persistent symptoms, although he describes some improvement on atenolol.  He denies radiation of the pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, syncope or near syncope.  He gives no history of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Question of a gout with no history in the past.

HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  PMI normal.  Negative jugular venous distention.  LUNGS:  Clear.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds times four.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm, without edema.  Pulses 2+ throughout except for trace to 1+ right pedal and trace posterior tibial pulses.  No femoral bruits heard.

IMPRESSION:  Angina pectoris, despite medical therapy.

PLAN:  Cardiac catheterization with further management based on findings.  Preprocedure teaching has been done.  The patient indicates his understanding and consents.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:  Cardiac catheterization was performed on August 2, 2002 revealing a normal left ventricle.  Coronary angiography revealed a normal left main; 70-90% stenoses of the proximal, mid and distal left anterior descending; 50% stenosis of the mid left circumflex with 99% stenosis of the mid obtuse marginal branch; and 90% stenoses of the proximal and mid right coronary artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complication.  His postprocedure course was stable.  Coronary artery bypass graft surgery was recommended to the patient.  Consult was made with cardiothoracic surgery.  The patient plans to return to see Dr. Elmer Fudd in the office to schedule surgery.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home in stable condition later that day.  He was continued on his preadmission medical regimen.  A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet was recommended.
