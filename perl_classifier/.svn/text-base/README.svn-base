README

This software semantically annotates medical discharge summaries for 
obesity and 15 most common co-morbidities. It is developed for the i2b2 
Obesity Challenge, and it is made available to challenge participants 
exclusively, for further information see COPYING. This is the system used
by the team referred to as 'Tikk et al.'.

The source code is messy and not well-documented, also comments may not 
conform to the actual revision of the code. If you want to understand
what it is doing, you probably would want to read the workshop paper or
the workshop presentation first.

The code is tried only on Linux based systems. 


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

perl, make, XML::Simple


INSTALLATION:
-------------

No installation required.


USAGE:
------

To perform annotation of documents file specified in Makefile:

This will produce annotation files and an easy-to-understand HTML file 
into the directory ./output/ Temporary files are written to ./textual and
./intuitive repectively.
