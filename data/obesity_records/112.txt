Imp: Hypoglycemia most likely from impair renal clearance of
glyburide. Possibly addition of colchinine/increased furosemide made this
worse.

glipizide. Note: pt has a possible allergy to sulfa which manifest as a
rash after taking an ?allergy medicine. Unlikely to have rash as tolerates
lasix ( sulfa containing ). Will have pt monitor for rash and call if has
any difficulties/prolonged hypoglycemia. VNA services to check in on
