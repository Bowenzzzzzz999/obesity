BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Marchionese is a 68-year-old man status post left lingula sparing
upper lobectomy on November , 2001 , for a T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma
of the lung. He was recently found to have a new right upper lobe nodule
by chest CT scan.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a right mini-thoracotomy , RUL
wedge resection , and mediastinal lymph node dissection , 5/29/2006 . The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to
the PACU and TICU without incident. For further details , please see the

The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. His diet was
advanced to a full house diet , his oxygen was weaned to room air , and his
home medications were restarted. POD #1 , following resolution of the air
leak and minimal output , the patient's chest tube was removed. A post
pull CXR showed a small apical space. POD #2 , the chest x-ray showed the
apical space to be stable. His epidural was capped and removed , foley
catheter removed and he voided without difficulty.
The patient was discharged in stable condition on POD #3. He was
tolerating a house diet , ambulating without need of assistance or
supplemental oxygen , and had good pain control on oral pain medication.
