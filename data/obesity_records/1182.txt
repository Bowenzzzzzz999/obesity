Stent stenoses , episodes of asymptomatic afib , aflutter , and atrial tachycardia with RVR
OTHER DIAGNOSIS;Conditions , Infections , Complications , affecting Treatment/Stay
cad ( coronary artery disease ) copd ( chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease ) niddm ( diabetes mellitus ) episodes of afib , aflutter , and
atrial tachycardia ( )
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization with angioplasty of OM and Diagonal arteries ,
and brachytherapy.
OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )
None
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
75yo male with COPD , NIDDM , and CAD s/p cath in
3/10 with stents of LCX and diag , presented to TH on 11/9/02 with CP ,
similar to that in 9/11 Pt described CP as pain
and pressure , extending from the middle of his chest up into his jaw.
Pain began when pt arose from his couch , and escalated quickly. CP only
ceased after nitro was administered in the ER 30 minutes later. At TH ,
pt ruled out for MI by enzymes , with
no EKG ischemic changes , and was treated with Lovenox. At TH , pt had
an episode of asymptomatic atrial
tachycardia , resolving spontaneously. On 8/11/02 ,
pt was transferred to PUO for cardiac cath and potential
stent/brachytherapy if necessary.
Hospital
course:
CV - Pt underwent cath 3/24/02. Both stents
from 3/10 were found to be stenosed ( LACX 85% and diagonal 95% ).
LAD had 50% stenosis. Stents were tx w/ angioplasty and brachytherapy.
Pt placed on integrilin IV for 14 hours. Pt ruled out per routine for
MI by CK after procedure. He had no episodes of chest pain after his
admission to TH .
- Pt has had multiple episodes of
asymptomatic
afib , aflutter , and atrial tachycardia , with RVR into the 150's , with
rate responding
well to 5mg IV lopressor. On 4/29/02 , lopressor increased to
75mg po tid in hopes of achieving rhythm/rate
control , unsucessfully. EP was consulted as to a possible ablation
procedure , but felt that medical management , if possible , would be a
better solution , given that multifocal atrial tachycardias and afib
would not necessary be resolved with an ablation procedure. The
patient also preferred medical management. On 1/27/02 , verapamil
40mg po tid was added to the regimen , with patient still having
episodes of rapid heart rate. Verapamil was increased to 80mg po
tid with resulting rate control. However , patient had two episodes
of asymptomatic low BP ( 90/50 ). On 4/6/02 , verapamil was decreased
to 60mg po tid , with both HR and BP control. Abnormal rhythms
continued , without RVR.
- Given afib/aflutter rhythms , patient was placed on coumadin 5mg po qd
on 1/27/02 ( prior to his procedure , he was maintained on heparin drip ,
and immediately post-procedure , he was maintained on integrilin drip ).
- Pt placed on statin at TH ; maintained on statin at PUO . Patient
maintained on asa.
- New d/c medications: Given difficulty of maintaining patient's heart
rate and blood pressure , pt was d/c'ed on verapamil and lopressor ,
both tid drugs. At f/u appt with cardiologist or PCP , this regimen
can be altered as appropriate. Pt also d/c'd on coumadin , plavix
( for 6months ) , and simvastatin.
Pulm - Severe COPD , treated with home O2.
Baseline O2 92% on 2L , and SOB with minor exertion. Pt
was tx w/ steroids until 6 months ago.
Continued on theophylline , flovent , serevent ,
guifenisin , atrovent inhaler prn. Stable while in hospital.
Endo - Pt was given one dose of solumedrol in TH . FS high ( low 200's )
on admission; he was begun on an insulin SS , but did not require
insulin while in hospital.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please return to hospital ER if you have any chest pain , increased
shortness of breath or oxygen requirement , dizziness , lightheadedness ,
fainting , or any other concerns. If you have palpitations or a
sensation of a racing heart , please call your primary care doctor.
Please go to Dr. Gari ' office on Monday for coumadin levels.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:

blood pressure control as appropriate.
