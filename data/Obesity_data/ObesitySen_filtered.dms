Discharge Date: 2/28/2006 ATTENDING: SPILLETT , SILVA M.D. ADDENDUM HOSPITAL COURSE: Neuro: Starting on 6/13/06 the patient had an episode of agitation on hemodialysis where he received Ativan and continued to be agitated and required multiple code greys to sedate him. 
A team meeting was held on 8/13/06 and per psychiatry recommendations the patient was started on 250 mg b.i.d. of Depakote , Haldol was reduced to just Monday-Wednesday-Friday 1 mg before hemodialysis and 1 mg p.r.n. agitation. 
The patient did very well on this regimen and his Depakote level was stable at 39.7 on discharge. 
The plan is to continue Depakote b.i.d. 250 mg with Haldol p.r.n. for behavior. 
In terms of his mental status on discharge , the patient was A&amp;O x3 and appropriate. 
In terms of cardiac , there were no additional events to report. 
In terms of pulmonary , the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia on 10/26/06 and started on ceftriaxone IV and Flagyl. 
This was changed to cefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. 
In terms of his pneumonia that was evident right lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray and the patient was also spiking fevers and had audible rales on exam. 
In terms of GI , the patient continued tolerate regular diet and nutrition continued to follow ensuring adequate p.o. intake and adjusting diet per endocrine needs. 
In terms of endocrine , the addendum to 6/13/06 , the patient ultimately discontinued on a regimen of 7 units of Lantus q.a.m. and q.p.m. with 5 units aspart q.a.c. breakfast and lunch and 4 units of aspart q.a.c. dinner. 
His sliding scale was very light and he is only to be covered with one to two units of aspart during the night as insulin stacks in this patient very easily. 
It was recommended if the patient is noted to be in the low 100s consistently through the course of the day that his next dose of aspart be either halved or held as the patient easily becomes hypoglycemic and is unable to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia himself. 
At the time of discharge , the patient's fingersticks were well controlled in the 100-200 range. 
In terms of ID , the patient began to spike fevers on 9/22/06 with a T. max of 100.6 and blood cultures failed to show anything as did sputum cultures. 
On 5/18/06 , the patient spiked to 101.2 and had evidence of pneumonia on his chest x-ray. 
He was started on antibiotics of ceftriaxone and Flagyl , which was switched to cefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. 
The cefpodoxime should be dosed after dialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday. 
In terms of disposition , the patient has been discharged to rehab where he will continue hemodialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday and continues to have the same medication Rx as he did well in house. 
Specific care should be given to his insulin regimen as well as his behavior control and nutrition as noted in the discharge instructions.

Discharge Date: 10/16/1990 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 40 year old female with a history of cholelithiasis who was recently discharged from Pagham University Of on November , l990 after an incisional hernia repair who , soon after , noted onset of right upper quadrant pain , vomiting , and fever and was readmitted with an ultrasound at that time showing two 8-9 mm gallstones in the right upper quadrant. 
ABDOMEN: Obese , positive bowel sounds , and non-tender with a small fascial defect at the umbilicus and a well healed midline scar.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Breisch is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease significant for an 80% mid circumflex , 95% mid right , 70% distal right , 50% distal left anterior descending coronary artery lesions with posterobasilar hypokinesis in the setting of a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction , hypertension times greater than 30 years , and an elevated cholesterol who was in his normal state of health until the morning of admission. 
While sitting comfortably in the Emergency Room at Tona Medical Center , the patient suffered a similar event of chest pain and tightness , which he reports to be approximately 1.5/10. 
One hour later , in A Salt Medical Center Emergency Room , the patient suffered a similar episode of chest pain and tightness , this time rated at 1/10 , with resolution of pain in approximately one minute , not requiring sublingual nitroglycerin. 
2. Hypertension times greater than 30 years. 
3. Hypercholesterolemia. 4. Hepatitis in 1991 , believed to be of a viral type with complete resolution of symptoms and no sequela. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. 2. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day. 
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had hypertension , grandmother with coronary artery disease. 
However , the patient's severe coronary artery disease lead the interventional radiologists to consider the patient for a laser wire type of PTCA in the event that PTCA was not successful. 
Since that time , the patient remained totally stable with no further events of chest pain and no EKG changes noted. 
Examination the following morning revealed no further bleeding , no hematoma , and good pulses distally , as well as a warm and dry left lower extremity. 
As the patient tolerated the procedure well and had no further complications , it was decided that the patient could be discharged the day following his catheterization , maintained on 250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.day. 
We suspect that Mr. Breisch will be able to return to his normal activities of daily living without any further disability.

TTE on 5/22 , decreased LV size , ejection fraction 80% , no wall motion abnormality , normal RV , moderate LAE , trace MR , TR , hypodynamic heart , PA systolic pressure at 38. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is an 80 years old female with history of AFib and CHF , diastolic dysfunction with EF of 80% and COPD who was recently discharged for CHF w low dose lasix of 20mg now is found to be in CHF in a setting with suspected AFib with LVR. 
Her beta-blocker was initially not initiated , however , on three days prior to discharge , she was started on short-dose beta-blockade due to hypertension. 
We did not want to over diuresis the patient given her volume dependence and the diastolic dysfunction especially as we suspect that the heart failure is secondary to her rhythm , but not really significant volume overload. 
We also started her on short acting beta-blocker with Lopressor at 6.25 t.i.d. 
Pulmonary: The patient has shortness of breath , despite secondary to CHF and COPD.

Therefore , the patient's dose of oral Lopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his blood pressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s and were not optimally controlled. 
However , the patient refused further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker regimen. 
The patient's beta-blocker should be titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73-year-old male with COPD , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , CHF , with ejection fraction of 60% , pulmonary hypertension , and arrhythmias who was discharged on 5/10/05 but returned later in the evening complaining of worsening shortness of breath and fevers at home. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is notable for a. fib with SVT not on Coumadin , hypertension , COPD with home oxygen at 2 liters , hyperlipidemia , gout , coronary vascular disease , chronic renal insufficiency , and type II diabetes controlled on diet. 
d. Hypertension: The patient had been noted to have a pulmonary artery pressure in 2003 in the 60s but on this admission had an echo at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary artery pressure was now at 98 mmHg. 
2. Cardiovascular: a. Pump: The patient has congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction around 60% as noted on an echo done on 9/30/05 .  
However , given his acute respiratory status , as well as his increasing edema during his hospital course , the patient was again aggressively diuresed for his CHF exacerbation with Lasix. 
b. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension. 
He was continued on telemetry and remained on a regimen of aspirin , beta blockers , as well as statin during this hospital course. 
However , the patient developed lower extremity edema with shortness of breath and required Lasix for his CHF exacerbation. 
His creatinine was followed closely during his hospital course and with Lasix diureses his creatinine did rise slowly to 1.4 , however , the benefits of diureses for CHF exacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly this is a 60-year-old  gentleman with COPD on 3 liters home O2 and a history of multiple past intubations to his noncompliant with his home oxygen therapy and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2 , coronary artery disease status post end-stomy , diastolic heart failure who presented to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath , chest tightness and wheezing times several days. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , coronary artery disease status post end-stomy , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia and gout. 
His abdomen is soft , obese , nontender and bowel sounds are present. 
The patient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructive sleep apnea. 
He is therefore discharged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup. 
This happened in the setting of continued auto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was due to a low flow state as result of heart failure rather than hypovolemia. 
His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension and he is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of his antihypertensive medicines have not changed. 
Abdomen is soft , obese , nontender , bowel sounds are present.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 98.4 , a pulse of 100 , a BP of 143/64 with a respiratory rate of 20 with a O2 saturation of 100% on 3 liters. 
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Significant for sodium of 131 , potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 20 , BUN and creatinine of 63/2.9 up from her baseline of 2. Her white blood cell count on admission was 4.5 with a hematocrit of 23.7 and platelets of 20. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ blood , 1+ bacteria and 2-4 white blood cells. 
She completed her course of famciclovir during hospitalization and had no further evidence of genital herpetic infection as well the urine culture and urinalysis data described above showed yeast only and a Foley that had been intermittently placed during the ED stay was discontinued , and the patient remained asymptomatic for any further urinary tract infection. 
Captopril and ARBs were not used due to her history of allergies but additional antihypertensive medications may be indicated if her pressure remains elevated. 
During the hospitalization , she had evidence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia asymptomatic on telemetry , however , with alteration of the dose of Lopressor there was no further evidence of this. 
Her blood glucose is not optimally controlled but more aggressive attempts to control her glucose resulted in symptomatic hypoglycemia , therefore it was felt best to air on the side of mildly elevated blood glucoses in the range of 150 to the low 200s in order to avoid transient hypoglycemia. 
A cardiac exam with regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , no murmurs and abdominal exam showing obese abdomen with ventral hernia but otherwise benign and lower extremities with 1+ edema and nontender.

RECORD #205
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation , chronic renal insufficiency , and non-small cell carcinoma of the left lung , status post resection in 1997. 
Notably , he was admitted to the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of in 5/23 for subacute shortness of breath , thought to be due to a CHF exacerbation , treated with Lasix diuresis. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure , ejection fraction 55% , concentric LV hypertrophy. 
4. Atrial fibrillation , diagnosed in 2005 , on Coumadin. 5. Diabetes mellitus , diagnosed more than 20 years ago , on insulin. 
8. Osteoarthritis , worst in the right knee. 
Gout. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily. 
The effusions were likely secondary to congestive heart failure , although pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions could not be excluded. 
Given that he was afebrile with a decreasing white count and not increasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusions were considered less likely compared to worsening CHF. 
Given the concern for CHF , he was given Lasix 40 mg IV approximately one to two doses a day for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balance of 2 liters negative per day. 
The etiology of his congestive heart failure and pleural effusions was therefore thought to be atrial fibrillation with RVR. 
The patient was maintained on Coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along with Zocor and Questran for hyperlipidemia. 
4. Diabetes: The patient had several bouts of hypoglycemia during the course of his hospitalization. 
We continued his Neurontin for neuropathic pain , and Tylenol for right knee osteoarthritis.

Discharge Date: ATTENDING: BOHANAN , SHEA M.D. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Kristian Maglione , NP SERVICE: DMCO PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Shortness of breath. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Thivener is a 49-year-old woman with a history of CHF , COPD on 3 to 4 liters at home , CAD , status post CABG , PE with a recent admission for cellulitis complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation as well as recent admission for shortness of breath and fluid overload complicated by PE while anticoagulated leading to a pulseless electrical activity. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily. 
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Vital signs stable. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A1 49-year-old woman with a history of CHF , COPD , CAD , status post CABG , status post PE with CHF exacerbation complicated by acute renal failure , hyperkalemia and UTI. 
Because of the patient's new onset of CHF , she was ruled out for MI shortly after admission. 
During her stay , the patient was maintained on an aspirin , beta-blocker and a statin , although the chest pain was gone on arrival to the ED. 
It was felt that this pain was likely secondary to GERD , as it often responded to Maalox , benzo , lidocaine and/or food. 
She passed through this acute decompensation with no further complications and was transferred back to DMCO on 7/7/06 .  
She was also anticoagulated for both her afib and a recent PE with an INR goal of 2 to 3. Rate control was obtained with the beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker. 
The patient was begun on verapamil , which was titrated up with her beta-blocker , which was titrated down. 
On admission , the patient had ARF felt to be due to CHF/volume overload leading to poor cardiac output , decreasing perfusion to the kidneys.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kington is an 80-year-old woman with known history of congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary edema who presents with gradually increasing shortness of breath for 2 weeks. 
She was found to be hypertensive , hypoxic with clinical and chest radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure. 
She was treated with oxygen , IV Lasix and nitro-paced in the ER and admitted for further treatment of her CHF exacerbation. 
LABS ON ADMISSION: Revealed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , bicarb 26 , BUN 31 , a creatinine 1.9 , a glucose of 152. 
She has coronary artery disease status post acute MI in 2001 , status post two-vessel CABG , she had the left internal mammary to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM-2. 
She has hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , bladder cancer status post resection. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Amiodarone 300 mg each day. 
ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION: She was an 80-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease here with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure exacerbation most likely left-sided diastolic dysfunction. 
Rhythm: In terms of her rhythm , she was found at several points throughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardia consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone; it was thought she would benefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker. 
A CT of the chest was done on this admission , however , it was consistent with CHF and other things could not be ruled out. 
The lung findings were consistent with cardiomegaly and CHF , but could not rule out other diagnostic possibilities including atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity , pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor. 
The liver showed a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it was hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the CT of 7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder was normal with no stones , the biliary tree was normal , as were the right kidney and left kidney , pancreas , although it was poorly visualized. 
Also , it was noted that she had prominent hepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure. 
Her primary care doctor can consider can titrating her CHF medicines and/or her hypertension medicines.

The patient reports no prior history of CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiac problems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attack at 27 years old. 
The patient also reports an episode of 30-minute chest tightness the day prior to admission while he was having a Foley catheter placed. 
Multiple myeloma ( Kappa ). 2. BPH. 3. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II. 4. Hypertension. 5. Nephrolithiasis. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Verapamil 180 mg once daily. 
2. Diabetes mellitus - The patient's sister died of complications of diabetes. 
Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiac catheterization at Tona Medical Center in 2001 , which showed no obstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary artery disease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to be likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , and increased leg edema and a low blood pressure. 
Because the patient was determined to be in CHF , he was diuresed with IV Lasix , and later with p.o. Lasix , the patient was diuresed approximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. 
After consultation with Cardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen as his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and congestive heart failure. 
After diuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had only minimal ectopy. 
He was , however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse him should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiac history. 
PHYSICIAN FOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient has been setup to follow with the CHF Clinic at Pagham University Of with Dr. Annabel Verfaille .

Abdomen revealed normal active bowel sounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatile liver. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment was that the patient presented in acute congestive heart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the setting of hypertension. 
Other contributing factors possibly playing a role in the patient's heart failure could have included medication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. 
Another possibility entertained was that the patient could have had transient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however all of her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning this possibility. 
4 ) Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remained in the range of 110-155/50-70s during her hospital course on Atenolol , Isordil and Lisinopril.

Congestive heart failure. 
Hypertension. 
Status post skin graft on right heel for diabetic ulcers in 1997. 
Hypercholesterolemia. Peripheral neuropathy. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Rodger Eagleman is a 66 year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease who presents to us with right leg swelling , pain and tenderness times 2-3 days. 
The patient was last discharged from Pagham University Of for congestive heart failure exacerbation and chronic abdominal distention on November , 2000. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for 1. coronary artery disease. 
2. Congestive heart failure. 
Complications include peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.9 and diabetic gastroparesis. 
4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Chronic low back pain. 
General examination: This is an obese woman lying at a 30 degree angle on the bed , pleasant and not in acute distress. 
In addition , levofloxacin was also started on hospital day #2 to cover gram negative organisms. 
We postulate that this is due to a combination of noncompliance with strict elevation , peripheral edema from congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease and diabetes. 
It was thought that her chronic distention is from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility. 
However , since the patient was stable with no further decrease in the hematocrit , it was decided that the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia in terms of colonoscopy. 
PROBLEM #8 , CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction.

Congestive heart failure: The patient had evidence for congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension during this hospitalization. 
The patient was instead started on spironolactone for management of her congestive heart failure. 
Ischemia: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease. 
She was maintained on aspirin , statin and a beta-blocker during the admission. 
At this time , the results of the inhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as an outpatient. 
Her oxygen requirement is thought to be due to atelectasis , deconditioning , as well as her known congestive heart failure and likely pulmonary hypertension. 
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and was followed by the Diabetes Nursing Service during her stay.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , myocardial infarction non-Q-wave September , 2001 , a MICU admission during that time , in September , 2001 , for urosepsis , diabetic ketoacidosis and this non-Q-wave MI. Also , sciatica with previous history of a herniated disc L5-S1 , question obstructive sleep apnea with mild pulmonary hypertension by previous echo. 
She was obese. 
Her abdomen was markedly obese , positive bowel sounds , nontender. 
Issues are as follows by systems: Pulmonary: Overnight pulse oximetry was performed , which will be analyzed to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. 
Patient will most likely need a form of sleep study at rehabilitation or as an outpatient to address this obstructive sleep apnea issue. 
Data from this admission do not support a diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome , because there was no daytime hypercapnia by both ABGs and Chem-7 panel. 
Patient will need sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old woman with longstanding hypertension , coronary artery disease ( status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 ) , hypercholesterolemia , positive tobacco use , positive family history for coronary artery disease , adult onset diabetes mellitus , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , peptic ulcer disease ( with history of gastrointestinal bleed ) , and stable angina who presented with rest angina in a crescendo pattern not relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. 
Cardiac catheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80% mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but was complicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the left anterior descending. 
The patient did well until 2/11 ( with rare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina which began approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graft and were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when she developed worsening right lower extremity claudication requiring angioplasty. 
The patient had an ongoing stable pattern of gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease that was minimized by avoiding fatty foods. 
5 ) Hypercholesterolemia. 6 ) Vascular disease as above. 
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother who died of a cerebrovascular accident , otherwise non-contributory. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This revealed an obese middle-aged woman who was feisty but in no acute distress. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended , obese with no hepatosplenomegaly , and no femoral artery bruits with 1+ palpable pulses bilaterally. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focal except for 4/5 right lower extremity proximal muscle strength , 1+ deep tendon reflexes throughout , and toes downgoing bilaterally. 
Cardiac catheterization revealed that her saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery had stenosed which was successfully PTCA to 20% residual stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Bown is a pleasant 52 year old obese black female with history of diabetes , chronic lower extremity venous stasis , history of cellulitis who presented with left lower extremity pain , edema , and erythema. 
In the past five years the patient has also become morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds. 
In October of 1996 she was treated for diabetic stasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV antibiotics. 
Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was attributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was thought to be compromising venous return. 
Bilateral lower extremity edema with chronic venous stasis changes. 
Hypercholesterolemia. Osteoarthritis. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese , pleasant , African American woman in no apparent distress. 
Her abdominal exam was obese , non-positive for bowel sounds. 
There was no rebound or guarding , no right upper quadrant tenderness , no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly ( exam limited by obesity ). 
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION: Sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 43 , and creatinine of 3.7. 
Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. 
She was continued on Ancef IV and p.o. Ofloxacillin which had been added for gram negative coverage. 
It was the impression of the Renal Service that the patient's acute renal failure was likely multifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy , low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , and medications which included NSAIDs as well as ACE inhibitor. 
Upper extremity non-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for any clots. 
Nystatin powder topical b.i.d. applied to groin area.

7 ) OSTEOARTHRITIS SECONDARY TO MECHANICAL DERANGEMENTS SECONDARY TO OBESITY. 
9 ) DEPRESSION. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year-old morbidly obese black female with a history of restrictive lung disease , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent lower extremity deep venous thromboses requiring multiple hospitalizations who was initially evaluated on March , 1996 for right knee pain. 
Evaluation revealed a small right knee effusion consistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity. 
She has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. 
She has been evaluated in the past with even trace apnea screen in August of 1994 which revealed approximately 19 apnea events in just over 10 hours. 
Apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start the patient on the C-PAP at home , but the patient had been resistant and she has a long history of medical non-compliance. 
She has a history of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she has had multiple medical admissions , most recently about six in the past year , most recently in October of 1996 , for cellulitis of the left lower extremity , in July of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness with negative non-invasive studies and in September of 1996 , most recently with right lower extremity cellulitis and this was complicated by apparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. 
The patient has chronic hypoxemia , obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic lower extremity deep venous thromboses and obstructive lung disease. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q. day. 2 ) Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 
Given the patient's history of restrictive lung disease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up to search for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs. parenchymal disease. 
The overall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was most likely secondary to obesity.

Discharge Date: 7/9/2000 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure. 
2. Diabetes mellitus. 
3. Hypertension. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old woman with coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy admitted with clinical shortness of breath. 
The patient has a long history of coronary artery disease with most recent echocardiogram in 8/06 showing dilated left ventricle , ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , inferior posterior thinning and akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal septum to apex. 
Diabetes mellitus , nonproliferative anemia , one non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 1981 , coronary artery bypass grafting in 1995 at Pagham University Of with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending graft , saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal graft. 
Several admissions for congestive heart failure including one in 1996 which included an echocardiogram with ejection fraction of 40%. 
Congestive heart failure admission in 2/11 with an echocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , decreased from previous echocardiogram. 
Hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , status post appendectomy , status post right mastoidectomy ( secondary to recurrent otitis ). 
Hematocrit of 35.5 with MCV of 80. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with presumptive diagnosis of recent tracheal bronchitis complicated by overlying congestive heart failure. 
An attempt to increase her beta blocker appeared to exacerbate this bradycardia and thus she was discharged on the same dose that she was admitted with , i.e. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine were thought secondary to her congestive heart failure and in fact , her creatinine decreased with diuresis.

RECORD #309
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with chest pain syndrome and known coronary artery disease admitted with increasing exertional dyspnea , thought to be his anginal equivalent. 
Cardiac catheterization , at that time , demonstrated 100% occlusion of the left circumflex artery which was heavily calcified and not amenable to balloon angioplasty. 
This probably represents a reflux disease. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin one tablet p.o. q.day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day , Verapamil SR 240 b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mEq q.day , Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and nitro patch 0.2 mg times two patches times two hours q.day. 
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 76-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery disease , known occlusion of the left circumflex with an exercise tolerance test one year ago without evidence for ischemia. 
His post catheterization course was slightly complicated by increased bleeding from the groin site , as well as the possible development of a hematoma versus pseudoaneurysm as a bruit was heard in the right groin. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.day , Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingually q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and pen-VK 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. times five days.

1-Epistaxis: may be secondary to anti-coagulation vs underlying blood dyscrasia vs allergic rhinitis vs recurrence of previous epistaxis ( possible AVM ) vs longstanding HTN vs tumor. 
It will be also important to assess for possible nasal AVM or ?tumor( low likelihood ). 
2-chest pain: ACS vs PE vs GERD vs panic attacks. 
An Echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but EF was 65% , no effusions were found , and there was only mild MR. Pt does not have an official DM dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk for glucose intolerance , thus a HbA1C will need to be obtained as an outpatient. 
Pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipid profile was obtained. 
Pt also has a hx of GERD , thus the c/p may have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or GERD as it radiated to the back and right shoulder. 
You must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , low fat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressure or even lead to heart failure.

Discharge Date: 6/23/2004 ATTENDING: MARCELINA STRAUHAL MD The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the last FEV1 of 0.42 , congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately 40% , who was transferred from Toalemraanne Hermwill General Hospital for continued treatment for worsening shortness of breath. 
She has a reaction to beta-blockers in which she has worsening breathing. 
2. Congestive heart failure , April 2003. 
5. Hypertension. 
6. Osteoarthritis. 
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
8. Depression and anxiety. 
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was thought to be a 60-year-old woman with severe COPD and CHF , who presented with worsening shortness of breath consistent with a COPD excerebration. 
However , this was unlike many of her previous exacerbations in that she did not experience any upper respiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venous pressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might be having a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well. 
However , lab results suggested that congestive heart failure was not a large part of her presentation. 
First , the brain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value of proximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 , suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of her heart failure. 
In terms of her heart failure , the patient was given IV fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heart failure. 
B. Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and after her sinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemia improved and she had no further issues. 
C. Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin HMG-COA reductase inhibitor. 
She was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospastic response to that , but she was continued on her angiotensin receptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved.

However , on repeat cuff pressure manually it was revealed that her blood pressure actually was normal and that there was dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of the automatic cuff , therefore it was thought that this low blood pressure was spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff that was being used. 
3. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. 
At this point , she will be discharged on that low dose of beta-blocker. 
We believe that she could probably be weaned slowly to significantly decreased pressure support and I believe most likely she will be able at some point to be taken off the ventilator , although this is certainly not certain.

She went to see her doctor , Dr. Viray in Clinic the next morning who found her to be in congestive heart failure and recommended her to go to I Warho Hospital .  
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Cardura , Vasotec and Metoprolol. 
Her chest x-ray showed an enlarged heart with pleural effusions and cephalization which was often shown with congestive heart failure. 
She was seen by the Cardiology Group who on further evaluation of her also felt that even with the resolution of her congestive heart failure she was ready to go home with adjustment in her blood pressure medications and felt that with her bradycardia she would not be able to tolerate her Lopressor. 
In that way she could have good control of her heart rate and maximization of her blood pressure medications and her increased tolerance of beta blockers.

RECORD #593
Discharge Date: 7/25/2005 ATTENDING: DEANDRA LAZARO GILFOY MD ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation. 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old gentleman with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a baseline ejection fraction recently estimated at 10-15% in September of this year. 
Upon presentation to the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of , patient reports other additional symptoms of CHF exacerbation including progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and cough productive of yellow phlegm dating back to most recent discharge from hospital on March , 2004 when patient was admitted for similar complaint of CHF exacerbation. 
Patient with multiple , multiple admissions in the last year to two years secondary to CHF exacerbation with exacerbations felt to be secondary to medication noncompliance as well as dietary discretion. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Lasix 100 mg t.i.d. , Regular Insulin sliding scale , lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Lantus 15 units SC q.h.s. , Protonix 400 mg p.o. q.d. 
VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION: Patient was afebrile at 96 , pulse of 84 , blood pressure 150/99 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 100% on room air. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for elevated jugular venous pressure with pulsation observant the ear at 90 degrees , estimated approximately 18 cm of water. 
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for sodium of 127 , hyponatremia felt to be secondary to chronic CHF exacerbation. 
As such , patient was admitted for evaluation and management of CHF exacerbation. 
CHF was felt to be secondary to medication and dietary noncompliance as previously mentioned. 
At the time of admission , CHF exacerbation not felt to be due to recurrent ischemia but rather medication indiscretion. 
B. Pump: Patient with decompensated heart failure on admission not felt to be in a low cardiac output state but rather just volume overloaded. 
At the time of discharge , patient felt to be relatively euvolemic though will likely require further outpatient evaluation and ongoing diuresis given his continued congestive heart failure. 
At the time of discharge , patient on 100 mg of torsemide b.i.d. with relatively good urine output and I/O of approximately negative 0.5 to 1 kg per day , would recommend intensive outpatient CHF management including multidisciplinary approach using heart failure nursing. 
ONGOING MEDICAL ISSUES AND OUTPATIENT ISSUES: 1. Patient will require further aggressive outpatient CHF management including ongoing diuresis using p.o. torsemide. 
4. Additionally , would recommend further diabetic teaching as an outpatient given patient's poor compliance. 
5. Strongly feel patient would benefit from involvement in a CHF program either through Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of or through other program.

ANALYSIS AND PLAN: On admission , this is a 59-year-old female with history of recent COPD and asthma exacerbation , diabetes , CHF , who presents with worsening shortness of breath and suspected right middle lobe pneumonia. 
Her restrictive lung disease is most likely secondary to her body habitus leading to obesity hyperventilation syndrome and her obstructive disease have components of asthma since has responsive bronchodilation after beta-agonist. 
It was also planned to use BiPAP since she might have sleep apnea component despite no objective data supporting that. 
Cardiovascular: A. Ischemia: The patient had recent workup for CAD including Cath which was negative , but she did have an elevation troponin which was likely secondary to demand ischemia with spontaneous resolution. 
We will not restart Isordil since patient had no evidence of coronary artery disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , sickle cell trait and chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ). 
For her rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , she had been long treated with methotrexate and allopurinol. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Rheumatoid and gouty arthritis: Previously on methotrexate and allopurinol , but due to worsening renal insufficiency , methotrexate was stopped in 5/3 , and Plaquenil was started in 7/21 .  
3. Hypertension. 
7. Chronic kidney disease , baseline creatinine of 1.9 ( ?of whether this is due to renal tubular acidosis or diabetes ). 
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: 1. NPH. 2. Plaquenil 200 mg b.i.d. 3. Allopurinol 100 mg daily. 
FAMILY HISTORY: Her mom passed away at age 79 and had coronary artery disease and diabetes.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Her sodium was 130 , potassium of 4.1 , chloride of 99 , bicarb of 22 , BUN of 78 , creatinine of 2.3 ( baseline creatinine 1.9-2.5 ) , glucose of 227. 
HER RELEVANT STUDIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: On 10/3/07 , pelvic and hip x-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing of the right SI joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the left hip. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait and chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted for diffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to a rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Body aches and joint pains: The differential diagnosis for the patient's body aches and joint pains initially included a rheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease , intra-abdominal process or Plaquenil reaction. 
By process of elimination , therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains was therefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although of note , her ESR and CRP were a bit higher than would be expected for a rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
4. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the range of 170s at multiple times during her hospitalization. 
5. Diabetes: The patient was started on NPH , short-acting prandial insulin and a sliding scale , all of which were up titrated while she was inhouse.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) in April , 1995. 
She had PCI to both vessels in the intervening period. 
3. Hypertension. 
4. Gout. 5. Anxiety and depression. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Pravachol 10 mg p.o.q.d.; Elavil 20 mg p.o. once a day; allopurinol 3 x week; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day; Accupril 10 mg once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a day; Xanax t.i.d. p.r.n. 
We continued her on her beta blocker and initially held her digoxin while we were controlling her rhythm. 
Pump: At the time of admission the patient was classified as having Class II heart failure although she did admit to not being very active and it was felt that if the patient exerted herself more she would have more symptoms. 
Her VTAC was thought to be primarily due to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discussed the need for an ICD with her. 
While the patient was currently in compensated heart failure , as mentioned previously it was felt that this was because she did not exert herself any further , and that it was likely that she would within the next year or two , decompensate and have more symptoms of congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old Mexican male with a history of coronary artery disease , who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting and presented with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the back and arm occurring 7 hours previously. 
The patient's history of c coronary artery disease began in 20 of June , when he developed substernal chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization showing a 100% right coronary artery occlusion and 80% left anterior descending occlusion , 70% proximal mid-left anterior descending lesion. 
In 1 of January , the patient underwent a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Golebiowski at Pagham University Of with a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending and right internal mammary artery graft to the posterior descending artery. 
However , the patient had persistent incisional-type pain after his coronary artery bypass grafting , but reported absence of his angina pain post-CABG. 
On the day of admission at 1:30 pm , the patient experienced severe 8 out of 10 substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm with numbness and neck tightness , associated with dizziness and numbness on the scalp. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION revealed that the patient reported using Nifedipine-XL 30 milligrams by mouth each day , enteric-coated aspirin 1 per day , occasional Indocin and colchicine. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray showed clear lungs and no pneumonia or congestive heart failure. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The initial impression was the patient had probable coronary disease and probable unstable angina. 
The patient had no further chest pain after his angioplasty , except for the baseline incisional pain which was unrelated to exertion.

PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CARDIOMYOPATHY. 2 ) STATUS POST MULTIPLE INJURIES. 3 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS B. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42 year-old gentleman with dilated cardiomyopathy with worsening functional status. 
His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy. 
He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this year. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 ) Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 
His abdomen was soft , non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. 
Neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry , but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy now presented with worsening functional status over the past few months as well as recent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. 
There was a question of patient non-compliance especially given his current alcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness for cardiac transplant at this time. 
His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued to have quite a significant improvement symptomatically with no further orthopnea in the hospital.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Congestive heart failure. 
3. Hypertension. 
4. Diabetes mellitus. 
He has a history of coronary artery disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) , hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. 
He is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea , and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent. 
The patient had these worsening heart failure symptoms after a trip to Tempe Leah Cu , some dietary indiscretion and a five-pound weight gain. 
He was transferred to Pagham University Of , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. 
ADMISSION LABORATORIES: Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of 5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip. 
The patient has an extensive history of coronary artery disease. 
He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin. 
By discharge , he was ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. 
Coronary artery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF exacerbation. 
On an outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. 
The patient's heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol , Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic improvement. 
His electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker. 
A more likely explanation for these findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate diuresis with his congestive heart failure. 
He should have low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat as well as a diabetic diet with ADA 2100 calories per day.

P: Pt's MMC notes list CHF as dx , pt denies any h/o LE edema or CHF before 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. 
Pt on exam has only LE edema , but received 120 IV lasix in ED. Pt's presentation c/w CHF exacerbation but BNP of 13 is unusual. 
Pt's LE edema likely multifactorial due to CHF and some component of chronic venous stasis. 
Pt was continued on BB , norvasc , &amp; catapres R: no issues this admit ENDO: Pt has h/o DM and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( unclear dose ). 
This is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea and rarely wears cpap at home. 
PULM: Pt with h/o sleep apnea. 
Per 2003 sleep study pt's sleep apnea was central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believe based on pt's body habitus and redundant neck tissue. 
Pulmonary thought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea ( central +/- obstructive ). 
Pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonary recs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt's with central sleep apnea and heart failure.

There are less chronic venous stasis changes on the left lower extremity. 
ASSESSMENT: Ms. Fausett is a 50-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension , and diabetes , was admitted for one week of worsening right knee redness , swelling and pain causing immobility. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/PROBLEM: 1. Leg swelling: The differential diagnosis that was considered for her leg swelling included deep venous thrombosis versus cellulitis versus septic joints versus gout versus chronic lymphedema with an acute worsening. 
Her beta-blocker was held as well as her lithium and her heart rate improved to the 50 and 60s. 
We would recommend holding the beta-blocker until follow up at her primary care physician's office for her next appointment. 
4. Renal: Acute renal failure on presentation with a creatinine of 1.6 and 1.0 is likely prerenal versus lithium toxicity versus a combination of these.

G V P VI. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 49 year old lady was admitted with increasing shortness of breath and increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilated cardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list. 
Her cardioangiogram at that time showed right dominant system without coronary artery disease and her exercise stress test revealed a VO2 of 12.6. 
It subsequently was revealed that there was a strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact , subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore altered from alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. 
In 3/26 she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for multiple gallstones. 
She represented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heart failure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril and Zaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic support for a short period of time. 
FAMILY HISTORY: As above shows strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy , with her mother dying at the age of 36 from a sudden cardiac death , her grandmother dying at the age of 52 from what appears to have been cardiomyopathy , and two of her brothers dying at the age of 32 and 42 with heart related problems. 
Two of her sons as I mentioned were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy , one of whom remains quite unwell. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg once a day; Diuril 500 mg once a day; digoxin 0.625 mg once a day; Colace 100 mg twice a day; Aldactone 25 mg once a day; Torsemide 100 mg in the morning , 15 mg in the p.m.; K-Dur 100 q. a.m.

She has a history of coronary artery disease in her family. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese woman in no obvious distress. 
Abdomen was markedly obese with a right upper quadrant tenderness to deep palpation. 
Cardiac catheterization was contemplated to rule out ischemia as her source of cardiomyopathy , but given that catheterization would likely require intubation secondary to sedation given her psych issues , the decision was made to pursue a more conservative course with treatment of medication. 
She was aggressively treated for congestive heart failure with digoxin , Ace inhibitor , and IV Lasix and she continued to get IV Lasix b.i.d. 40 mg. 
She had total body edema and anasarca with slightly decreased protein and albumin , but most likely secondary to severe congestive heart failure.

To rule out concern for ischemia as a role in the deterioration of his cardiomyopathy , a left heart catheterization was performed which showed worsening CAD from his prior study 5 years. 
Given the patient's symptoms and echocardiographic evidence of cardiomyopathy proceeded the progression of his CAD , it is likely that his arteriosclerosis was not the primary etiology of his imparied cardiac performance though may be contributing to his disease at this time.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. 
Originally she had been on vancomycin for a urinary tract infection and when the course was complete for the urinary tract infection , the patient was switched to Keflex for prophylaxis versus skin infections. 
4. Low albumin state: The patient has a low prealbumin suggestive of decreased PO intake versus decreased synthetic function of the liver. 
The patient refused ??___?? placement for tube feeds. 
6. GERD: This patient was treated with Nexium and p.r.n. 
8. Infectious Disease: Postoperative prophylaxis: Immediately postoperatively , the patient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxis versus perioperative infection. 
Differential diagnosis was PE versus pneumonia versus volume overload. 
Cardiovascular: Pump: The patient has no known heart failure. 
Ischemia: The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease. 
She was continued on her beta-blocker. 
As noted above , the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spa versus spa and Lasix. 
The first was right total knee replacement. 
It was thought that the supertherapeutic INR could relate to Coumadin effects versus nutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1. STATUS POST D/C CARDIOVERSION. 2. STATUS POST MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT. 
3. HISTORY OF RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Lippman is a 71 year old woman with a history of mitral valve replacement , atrial fibrillation , diabetes mellitus , who presents with light-headedness x 1 day. 
Mrs. Lippman has a history of rheumatic heart disease and is status post commissurotomy in 1965 and a St. Jude's mitral valve replacement in 1991. 
In October 1992 she presented in atrial fibrillation which was well controlled on Quinidine. 
The Quinidine was discontinued the following year in April when the patient had a syncopal episode. 
At that time , she ruled out for myocardial infarction and failed Sotalol with increasing PR and QT intervals. 
Holter study was negative at that time. 
Persantine scan showed no ST changes noted and a fixed defect was present. 
The patient was discharged on Lopressor. 
On August , 1993 she was admitted with right ankle pain , right lower extremity swelling. 
Lineis were negative at that time. 
On 10/5/93 she was admitted in atrial flutter with II:I conduction. 
Trial of procainamide was complicated by increasing QT intervals. 
The Procainimide was therefore discontinued and the Propafenone was begun. 
The patient underwent successful DC cardioversion and was discharged on Propafenone 225 t.i.d. and Lasix 80 q day. 
Since the morning before admission she felt light-headed and sweaty. 
She began to run out of Propafenone two days before admission and decreased the dose to 150 mg three times a day. 
She felt her heart was going slower than normal. 
This was worse when standing or walking. 
However , she had no chest pain , shortness of breath , loss of consciousness. 
She had no diarrhea , no vomiting , her blood sugars have been in the usual range of 180-200 mg%. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As noted above. 
The patient has clean coronary arteries by catheterization October 1991. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a very pleasant female , appearing younger than her stated age , in no acute distress. 
Her blood pressure is 134/80 without orthostatic change. 
Her mouth appears dry but is otherwise unremarkable. 
Cardiovascular examination notes a regular rate and rhythm with a prominent mid-systolic prosthetic valve click. 
There were bilateral crackles at the bases. 
The abdominal and rectal examinations are normal , stool is guaiac negative. 
Extremities showed pigmentation changes in bilateral lower extremities with well preserved pulses except the dorsalis pedis pulses which are weak. 
Neurological examination is unremarkable. 
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute , axis 145 degrees , PR interval of 132 milliseconds , no significant change from previous EKG from February 1993. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , placed on cardiac monitor and Holter monitor. 
On the morning following admission she was clearly in atrial flutter with II:I conduction block as confirmed by the Holter monitor. 
Her prothrombin time was 25.2 , therefore , on the second hospital day , she underwent successful DC cardioversion with 52 joules. 
The procedure was carried out without complications; afterwards , the patient was in normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block and a PR interval of 300-320 milliseconds. 
The patient was observed through the next day , remained in normal sinus rhythm except for short periods of SVT with sinus pause. 
She was asymptomatic and was able to exercise around the hospital floor and up and down the stairs. 
Anticoagulation. 
The patient is maintained on chronic Coumadin anticoagulation and at the time of admission she was continued on her outpatient maintenance of 7.5 mg q hs. 
However , over the first hospital day prothrombin time increased from 22.3 on admission to 28.6. 
Therefore , her Coumadin was held. 
The prothrombin time was 29.1. 
The prothrombin time on discharge was 32 , INR of 3.3 and the patient was instructed to continue on 5 mg of Coumadin q hs and to see Dr. Aspacio in the clinic for PT check in the next week. 
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: Propafenone 225 mg p.o t.i.d.; Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d. until May , 1993; Lasix 80 mg p.o. q d; Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; NPH Insulin 10 mg subcu q a.m.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q h.s.; Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q d; Slo-K 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. 
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. 
Instructions are given to followup with Dr. Annette Schoultz in the KTDUOO clinic.

A beta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated to a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. 
He has had no further episodes of chest pain. 
2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was titrated. 
He was restarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as well as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. 
The patient will be followed by Dr. Annabel Verfaille in the Doau Hampcacleve as well as by the CHF Service at Pagham University Of . 
He had decreased episodes of more rapid dysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his medication regimen. 
However , after a substantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service and the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the risks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of significant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of thromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot and thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin anticoagulation. 
As mentioned , the decision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the patient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin anticoagulation. 
The left internal carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus stenosis. 
The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery bypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Beckfield is a 68-year-old dutch speaking man with a known history of coronary artery disease , who was in his usual state of health until August , 1999 when he began to developed right upper quadrant pain , and was seen by his primary care physician and sent to the emergency room with a diagnosis of possible early acute cholecystitis. 
( 2 ) Hypertension. ( 3 ) Diabetes. ( 4 ) Hyperlipidemia. ( 5 ) History of posterior thoracic abscess , removed in April 1995. 
The patient was then advanced on his diet , which he tolerated with no further symptoms. 
( 2 ) Cardiovascular: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease , a cardiology consult was obtained by the Surgical Service , who then continued to follow the patient once he was transferred to the Medical Service. 
Preoperative evaluation for possible cholecystectomy was performed , and it was noted that the patient's coronary artery disease included the following history: The patient had a coronary catheterization in 1995 , which revealed a 30 percent left anterior descending artery , proximal as well as mid stenosis , as well clean circumflex , 70 to 90 percent obtuse marginal lesion , and a 40 percent , 40 percent , and 70 percent serial right coronary artery lesions , as well as a 70 percent posterior descending artery lesion. 
The cardiology consult concluded that given the patient's history of coronary artery disease , a recommendation was made to perform a nuclear imaging study to assess the patient's ischemic risk for a cholecystectomy. 
Persistent hypertension was controlled by increasing the dose of beta blocker with good response. 
Given that the patient remained symptom free from a cardiac standpoint , cardiology consult decided that the patient's cardiac catheterization would be deferred until after this hospitalization , in light of the possible complications of adding a TB3A antagonist during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the context of possible ERCP.

ADMISSION DATA: Chest x-ray was within normal limits. 
The etiology of the patient's left arm and chest symptoms and syndromes also was not identified during this admission , however , the medical team suspects it may be related to a cervical spinous process , potentially arthritis , disc herniation or nerve root impingement. 
Given the negative echocardiogram , the Card Service wanted to rule out ischemia-induced arrhythmia , so a MIBI was performed , and the patient was started on low-dose beta-blocker and aspirin. 
They stated that if tolerated , the beta-blocker could be continued and that the patient should be set up as an outpatient for a loop recorder. 
No further workup for coronary artery disease was indicated. 
7. Miscellaneous: The patient was screened by the Physical Therapy Service who recommended a home safety evaluation. 
Alternatively , the medical team speculates that the patient may have cervical spinal arthritis , lumbar herniation or nerve root impingement contributing to these symptoms.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine 2.1 , glucose 107 , calcium 8.4. 
Toxicology screen was negative. 
EKG on arrival to the emergency room showed an irregular ventricular rate at 156 which was likely atrial fibrillation vs flutter. 
The patient was initially continued on simvastatin. 
Because of the worry of CHF , ( History of low EF , possible orthopnea ) an echocardiogram was performed which showed LVEF only 25% with global hypokinesis and inferior/posterior akinesis. 
The etiology of his heart failure was unclear as he had never had a known myocardial infarction in the past. 
The patient was subsequently taken to cardiac catheterization to determine whether he had coronary artery disease. 
There was no coronary artery disease on left heart cath. 
Aspirin and simvastatin were discontinued given lack of coronary artery disease for the sake of simplifying his medical regimen in order to optimize the chance of medical compliance. 
The most likely cause of this proteinuria was thought to be CHF , although , the patient should have renal follow up. 
Allopurinol was given for his history of gout.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Baffa is a 72 year old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath. 
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave changes. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly obese African-American woman lying in bed in some mild respiratory distress. 
Therefore , while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood pressure regimen was advanced. 
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d. for further diuresis. 
This was felt to be out of proportion to her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought. 
A pulmonary consultation was obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on room air. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipine extended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and Lasix 20 milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. 
The patient first went to Forestblan Conwake Hospital ER then left AMA without further treatment after waiting four hours. 
He understood that he was not likely to live long with the severity of his heart failure. 
This has been discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration given the degree of his heart failure. 
His abdomen was somewhat decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.

PULMONARY EMBOLUS 2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness of breath and left pleural effusion. 
Subsequently she had done quite well until February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and left-sided heart failure. 
3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
Abdomen is soft and non-tender , slightly distended. 
This clinical picture was felt to be mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. 
Given the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically for a pulmonary embolus. 
In addition the patient underwent lower extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no evidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus.
