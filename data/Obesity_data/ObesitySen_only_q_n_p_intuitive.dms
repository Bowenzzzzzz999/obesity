The patient had chest pain the succeeding months and had two catheterizations showing no change in her coronary arteries. 
Maximum heart rate 162 , blood pressure 176/90 , no ST or T wave changes. 
In April 92 she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and EKG , after presenting with prolonged chest pain. 
Chest CT ruled out aortic dissection. 
In February 1993 the patient had additional sharp chest pain , again ruled out for myocardial infarction , was seen by the Pain Services and discharged on trazodone and Relafen plus cardiac medicines. 
The patient now presents to the hospital with 24 hours of right sided chest pain , stating that it was squeezing in her right breast , felt to be between the shoulder blades. 
She took two sublingual Nitroglycerin the day before admission and three on the morning of admission without relief. 
She complained of shortness of breath , dizziness , weakness and nausea , no palpitations were noted. 
The pain was not worse with positional changes. 
She had no fever , chills , cough , she did complain of urinary frequency , chronic left back pain and right lower extremity pain. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pulse 92 , blood pressure 148/100 , temperature 98.1 , she is an obese female in no acute distress. 
Cardiac , regular rate and rhythm , SI , SII , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
The pain is not reproducible by palpation. 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of 90 beats per minute , normal intervals , left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Compared with the examination of 2/7/93 T wave inversions were less deep in V3 through V5. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial EKG and enzymes. 
On 11/28/93 the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronary arteries , mildly elevated pulmonary pressure of 40/24 and mean of 30 , capillary wedge pressure of 14 mm mercury. 
On the afternoon of 5/10 the patient had 600 mg of Levatol and two hours later complained of light-headedness with a systolic blood pressure in the 80's. 
She was also noted to have the onset of wheezing. 
02 sat was 95% on five liters of oxygen , chest x-ray showed cardiac enlargement with regeneration of the pulmonary flow suggestive of mild congestive heart failure.

2. Pulmonary hypertension. 
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old  female with a past medical history of significant obesity , diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , heart failure , pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2 who presented with shortness of breath , and left jaw pain on 8/10/2003 .  
She was given sublingual nitrate with no effect. 
Because of her history of coronary artery disease , she was tried on heparin and aspirin. 
She was a moderately obese woman in no acute distress. 
Her lung are notable for crackles at the bases. 
Her cardiac exam was notable for distant heart sounds with a normal S1 , S2. She had no pedal edema in her extremities. 
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for a BUN and creatinine of 31 and 1.1. 
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was a 62-year-old female with morbid obesity and chronic episodes of shortness of breath , this time accompanied by jaw pain and with a history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factors concerning for acute coronary syndrome. 
The patient was initially treated for a possible ischemic event. 
Diagnosis of PE results were considered. 
However , the patient was not tachycardic. 
She did not have any chest pain or new O2 requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolism during prior hospitalization with similar systems , so therefore , this was thought to be less likely. 
She was maintained on telemetry , and she had EKG checked , which did not reveal any changes. 
This was a patient who had a dobutamine MIBI , which was negative for any evidence of ischemic changes. 
During the MIBI , there was no evidence of ischemia and/or scar. 
An echocardiogram was repeated during this hospitalization , which was notable for an EF of 60% , trace-to-mild MR , moderate TR , and estimated pulmonary systolic pressure at 70 mmHg. 
In terms of the patient's rhythm , she had no evidence of arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization. 
At times , the stools were notable for bright red blood. 
To further evaluate this , a CT scan of the abdomen was done , which was notable for a thickened colon for 10 cm at the hepatic flexure. 
She is no longer having any abdominal pain , and she needs no longer having any diarrhea and is tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. 
To establish that the patient did not have any PE , she had lower extremity Doppler exams , which were negative. 
She also had a PT protocol CT , which was negative for any evidence of clots. 
Because the patient does have cardiopulmonary hypertension , she was started on Coumadin as prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in her pulmonary vasculature. 
The thought of the team was that this represented a renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea , fluid losses , and hypertension. 
ID: The patient's hospital course was notable for a diarrhea as mentioned in GI. 
RHEUMATOLOGY: On 10/27/2003 , the patient was noted to have left knee pain and was noted to have some focal lateral patellar tenderness and swelling. 
A knee aspirate was performed and urate crystals were identified , and the patient was diagnosed with gout. 
Because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea , the decision was made to treat her gout flare with steroids , and she is currently is on a steroid taper as treatment. 
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes. 
She was initially continued on an outpatient regimen; however , when she started to begin having massive diarrhea , she was taken off her long-acting insulin , because she was not taking anything by p.o. At this time , she was not tolerating a regular diet , and her insulin requirements were increasing.

On review of systems , the patient denies chest pain , shortness of breath , cough , URI symptoms , rash , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , dysuria , palpitations , fevers , sweats or chills and overall reports feeling well. 
7. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
General appearance: The patient is in no acute distress at present. 
There is no palatal petechiae. 
There is no scleral icterus present. 
There is no lymphadenopathy or masses present. 
Skin: There is no stigmata of endocarditis. 
There are no splinter hemorrhages. 
Cultures were also taken from the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA , few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. 
The patient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any significant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis. 
Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have remained negative to date. 
However , given the patient's high risk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also negative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. 
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or chest discomfort. 
His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. 
Electrolytes were checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium above 4. However , no other medical management was initiated given his bradycardia. 
A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07 for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a full six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week course of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite both negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram given his high risk for endocarditis. 
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units nightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin. 
On general exam , the patient is in no acute distress. 
Abdomen is soft , obese , nondistended and nontender. 
Suprapubic catheter site is without purulence or erythema. 
Extremities: There is 1+ pitting edema to the shins bilaterally with chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally. 
Skin: There are no rashes present. 
There are no splinter hemorrhages or Osler nodes noted. 
At the time of discharge , there are two blood cultures that are no growth to date but needs to be followed up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Daughtrey is a 75-year-old female with diabetes , coronary artery disease , status post CABG in 1995 , recent MIBI , stress test in July with a small area of reversible ischemia inferiorly who had peripheral vascular disease , right CVA status post IVC filter for DVT , triple AAA , status post repair , COPD , who presented to Norap Valley Hospital with nausea of unclear source and deep lateral T wave inversions in EKG leads V2-V6. 
She was at that time on treatment for a left foot diabetic ulcer on Augmentin. 
Over the last week prior to admission , she had increasing nausea , diarrhea without abdominal pain. 
She did have mild fevers and increased cough though she had no chest pain , orthopnea or urinary complaints. 
They transferred her to Pagham University Of for consideration of cardiac catheterization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Type II diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy. 
13. Left foot diabetic ulcer , has been treated with multiple different antibiotic courses including levofloxacin , Flagyl , and nasalide , as well as Augmentin. 
6. Erythromycin , again , the patient does not remember any reaction , but apparently has hives. 
It is not clear if this is a rash or it was thought to be possibly related to a fever that the patient had , but it is not clear what the actual reaction is. 
In general , she is in no acute distress. 
Her abdomen was soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with good bowel sounds. 
Her extremities were significant for erythema of the left shin without warmth or tenderness. 
There was no purulence or purulent drainage from the wound. 
There were no significant left main lesions identified. 
The coronary artery bypass grafts had a patent LIMA to LAD graft , the SVG to marginal I had a 100% lesion during this catheterization due to the moderate amount of contrast and the patient's chronic kidney disease , they treated the RCA and placed a 3 x 24 mm Taxus stent ECHOCARDIOGRAM: On 7/9/07 , showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% with inferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis. 
The echocardiogram as noted above showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease. 
She was taken to the cath lab on 9/5/07 and they show two ____ that one of the bypass grafts was completely occluded and was not visualized. 
Because of her kidney insufficiency , it was decided not to pursue the 80% left circ lesion and this was deferred until later point as this was not thought to be causing any problems. 
She did not complain of any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission. 
b. Pump: The patient had no significant issues with her blood pressure here. 
She was continued on her beta blocker as noted above. 
However , at discharge , this was switched back to atenolol as her home medications and she refused to change medications , she said that she would not be able to afford new prescription. 
It was on the lower side here , so we did not add it. 
We did not diurese her in fact we held her Lasix on admission because she seemed to be volume depleted given that she was admitted with a lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsidered if she had increased edema. 
C: Rhythm: The patient was kept on telemetry , however , there were no significant episodes of arrhythmias during her admission. 
It was unclear what the etiology of this diarrhea was and we were going to send a repeat stool study , however , she did not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be antibiotics associated diarrhea but it seemed to resolve spontaneously. 
We initially continued her on Augmentin , which she was taking for her diabetic foot ulcer. 
However , she did not appear to clinically respond to this medication. 
We held her antibiotics as noted below in the ID section and after that her white blood cell count increased and she produced some purulent sputum and Gram-negative rods. 
The Gram-negative rods were later speciated as serratia although this information is not available at the time of her discharge. 
4. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted on Augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the notes from Norap Valley Hospital by the Infectious Disease Service recommended a 2-4 week course of Augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer. 
She had completed three weeks of therapy and thus we discontinued this medication as it did not seem that there was really any evidence of active infection in her foot. 
Her sugars were relatively well controlled and she did not require much in the way of supplemental insulin. 
Because of the risk for kidneys , the cath was done with a little amount of dye as possible. 
They felt that this was possible. 
Cellulitis/diabetic foot ulcer: The patient has had a longstanding diabetic foot ulcer which has been treated by wound care VNA and was treated at Norap Valley Hospital .  
There was no evidence of active infection , there was no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcer and the erythema around the foot appeared to be stable , this was most likely chronic venous stasis change and not a true cellulitis as there was no warmth or tenderness in this region. 
In general , she was in no acute distress. 
There is no associated warmth or tenderness. 
She did have a 1.5 cm small ulcer on the ventral aspect of her left foot , which did not have any purulence associated with it. 
PENDING TESTS: As noted , the patient had a sputum culture that was growing Gram-negative rods at the time of discharge. 
The patient has an 80% left circumflex lesion which was not stented. 
She does appear to be asymptomatic , but she does continue to have the deep lateral T wave inversion suggesting the areas of abnormal blood flow in the heart. 
If the rash resolves on ticlopidine , she may need to readdress whether or not this was actually due to Plavix.

Discharge Date: 10/25/1995 PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: FEVER , STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA; 2 ) THROMBO- CYTOPENIA HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Breckenridge is a 50 year old male who is ten years status post cardiac transplant for an ischemic cardiomyopathy , who presents with a five week history of a flu like illness and fevers. 
Cardiac transplant was in 1985 without complications and in 1989 he had one episode of herpes zoster , and was treated for cataract. 
He remained stable without cardiac symptoms or exertional limitation. 
Last had a cardiac catheterization in April of 1994 , showed no evidence of coronary artery disease , normal LV size and function , normal RV and trace MR. Right heart catheterization on 7/10 showed normal hemodynamics. 
There was no evidence of rejection on biopsy. 
There was no history of signs or symptoms localizing infectious process until about five weeks prior to this admission when he developed a flu like symptom , including a dry cough , occasionally productive of whitish sputum , general malaise , nasal congestion with occasional blood streaked secretions , arthralgias and fatigue. 
Has had anorexia with a 15 pound weight loss in the past month. 
He is immunosuppresed with Cyclosporin , Prednisone and Imuran. 
The patient has no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a middle aged male in no apparent distress. 
His skin was within normal limits , mild scleral icterus. 
Jugular venous pressure was 6 cm. 
Carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. 
There is no thyromegaly or adenopathy. 
Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2. 
There are no murmurs , gallops or rubs. 
His PMI was non displaced. 
Abdomen was soft and non tender , non distended , normoactive bowel sounds with no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities without cyanosis , clubbing or edema or rashes. 
Distal pulses were 2+ bilaterally and neurological exam was completely non focal. 
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Of significance , BUN was 27 , creatinine 1.8 , white blood cells were 5.3 , with 71% PMNs and 10% bands , 4% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes and 4% eosinophils. 
There was no infiltrates or effusion. 
There were no acute changes. 
His blood smear showed no evidence of hemolysis. 
There are no schistocytes. 
Of note is hyperbilirubinemia with an elevated LDH , in conjunction with anemia , suggestive of hemolysis and also thrombocytopenia. 
The patient had multiple blood cultures , sputum cultures , sputum analyses and titers drawn with a completely negative workup , except for E. coli noted on several sputum stains but there is no other evidence for pneumonia. 
The patient was empirically treated for several days on intravenous Cefuroxime with no change in his fever curve , which had ranged from 100 to 102 degrees for all the days of admission except the last 24 days of admission when patient was afebrile. 
With regards to the patient's anemia , there was no specific diagnosis made , despite extensive workup. 
The hematology oncology service was consulted , and stated that the patient's peripheral smear was normal , as it had been by our reading. 
They still wanted to check a PNH screen and G6PD level in three to four weeks following discharge for possible explanations of his hemolytic anemia , although may be possibly related to a viral illness as well. 
By the time of discharge , the patient's hematocrit was stable at 30% and there was no further increase in the patient's LDH or bilirubin; in fact those levels were resolving by the time of discharge. 
The thrombocytopenia again may be related to the viral illness and there is no evidence for hemolytic uremic syndrome or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. 
Also during this visit , a PPD was checked and it was found that the patient was anergic , as might be expected with all of his immunosuppressive drug regimen. 
At the time of discharge , the patient was feeling well and no longer complaining of his flu like syndrome. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , 81 mg P O q d; 2 ) Cyclo- sporin , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 3 ) Colace , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 4 ) Vasotec , 10 mg P O b.i.d.; 5 ) Mevacor , 20 mg P O q d; 6 ) Magnesium oxide , 420 mg P O q day; 7 ) Prednisone , 10 mg P O q AM; 8 ) Diltiazem CD , 180 mg P O q d; 9 ) Imuran , 150 mg P O q d CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home , feeling well and was no longer complaining of symptoms.

RECORD #17
Discharge Date: 2/12/1991 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: CHIEF COMPLAINT was a 57 year old man who was status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times 2 , of a left anterior descending stenosis for unstable angina , and was admitted for new onset of angina at rest. 
The patient's cardiac risk factors included family history , borderline high cholesterol. 
The patient had no prior cardiac history , until 12 of June , when he had substernal chest pain with exertion. 
He eventually had cardiac catheterization which showed an 80% proximal left anterior descending lesion with thrombosis , good left ventricular function. 
The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to this lesion. 
He was without symptoms for about 4 weeks , and then in 23 of August , the patient noted new onset chest pain and left arm numbness at rest. 
The electrocardiogram showed 3 to 4 millimeter ST depressions in the lateral leads , which was highly predictive of coronary artery disease. 
At that time , he was repeat cardiac catheterization which showed a restenosis of his left anterior descending lesion. 
He had a repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion without complications. 
However , 6 days prior to admission , the patient began to note occasional episodes of left arm numbness , which was always relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. 
There was no accompanying dizziness , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. 
The patient at first had 2 or 3 episodes a day , now increased to 7 or 8 times a day at the time of admission. 
The patient was very concerned about the pain , and now comes to Pagham University Of for further evaluation. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included arthritis , kidney stones , chronic lower back pain. 
ALLERGIES included no known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient was a retired firefighter , occasional red wine , no tobacco use. 
His brother had 3 myocardial infarctions in the past , no other FAMILY HISTORY. 
There was no jugular venous distention. 
Cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no peripheral edema. 
The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 50 , normal intervals , flat T-waves in AVF , V2 and V3 , QRS axis 0 degrees. 
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or effusions , no evidence of congestive heart failure. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on a rule out myocardial infarction protocol. 
He had no elevations in his serum creatinine kinase levels. 
For this reason , he was taken back for cardiac catheterization , which showed a 75% proximal left anterior descending lesion believed to be at the same site as his previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures. 
The patient had successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion with a 25% residual stenosis. 
The patient postoperatively had no further episodes of chest pain or arm numbness. 
He had no complications related to the cardiac catheterization itself.

RECORD #18
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Decompensated congestive heart failure , status post bilateral knee amputation , status post BKA. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 73-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft , ischemic cardiomyopathy , valvular heart disease , known EF of 15-20% as of 9/19 , was admitted to the Pagham University Of from Sollic Fredlaer Rehabilitation Hospital Of with signs and symptoms of decompensated heart failure , and acute on chronic renal failure. 
He was discharged to acute rehabilitation and was there noted to have this acute renal failure , which was thought to be due to prerenal azotemia , but his creatinine at this point had not changed much from 2.2 to 2.5 during his stay. 
Patient denies any other symptoms up to that point except occasional lightheadedness , depressed mood , and lack of motivation. 
No orthopnea , uses 1 pillow regularly , denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and denies dyspnea on exertion , but very limited movement. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , GERD , hypercholesterolemia , CAD status post MI in 1996 , received a CABG in 5/12 with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , SVG to OM1 , and mitral valve annuloplasty. 
Diabetes mellitus , insulin-dependent , status post bilateral below the knee amputation , likely from diabetes related foot ulcers , history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter , history of sick sinus syndrome , history of second-degree heart block , AICD placed 10/27 complicated by hematoma. 
IMPRESSION: On admission , a 73-year-old male with severe cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction of 15% admitted for decompensated heart failure in the setting of his diuretics being held due to an acute renal failure. 
Other active issues he was treated for include urinary tract infection , diabetes mellitus , acute on chronic renal failure , depression. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Known coronary artery disease status post CABG x3 , admitted with troponin elevation likely due to demand in the setting of heart failure for having his diuretics held. 
Two days prior to discharge , his creatinine began to rise , suggesting prerenal azotemia secondary to over diuresis and when his torsemide was reduced to 100 mg p.o. daily , hydrochlorothiazide was dropped from his regimen , patient's creatinine began to drop again , and patient was able to maintain even Ins and Outs of fluid for two days prior to discharge. 
5. Renal: Initial acute on chronic renal failure thought secondary to volume overload and forward flow in the context of decompensated congestive heart failure. 
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis as was test for urine eosinophils. 
Hyponatremia was likely due to heart failure improved with diuresis. 
8. Psych: The patient was restarted on Celexa per PCP for likely depressive mood response to recent bilateral knee amputation. 
It is what is quite possible that patient's depression precedes the bilateral knee amputation and informs much of his overall care. 
Head CT at that time showed no evidence of bleed or trauma to the head to head. 
Examination of back and extremities reveals no focal tenderness or ecchymoses. 
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient remained on cardiac , 2000 calorie diabetic diet , however , as it became apparent that he was severely malnourished , his diet was liberalized to allow for nutritional supplementation. 
2. Maintain new prescription of Remeron , follow up with psychiatry to assess depressive disorder/adjustment disorder. 
3. The patient has been off beta-blocker. 
PCP may choose to start beta-blocker at a low-dose in the outpatient setting. 
5. The patient had rising alkaline phosphatase during hospitalization , CT of chest incidentally showed gallstone present within the gallbladder , follow up LFTs in the outpatient context and possible right upper quadrant ultrasound may merit consideration and further outpatient workup of this patient.

RECORD #19
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old , white male with cardiac risk factors of diabetes , borderline hypertension , male gender , and a positive family history , who has no prior cardiac history , but now presents to A Salt Medical Center complaining of substernal chest pain. 
Approximately six weeks ago , the patient lifted a 100-pound bag and the next a.m. , noted substernal chest pressure without associated symptoms. 
On arrival , the patient's pain had dwindled to 1/10 , without associated symptoms. 
The patient was admitted for further treatment and to rule out myocardial infarction. 
The patient gives no history of edema , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. 
The patient denies fevers , upper respiratory infection symptoms , cough , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , or weight loss. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is significant for diabetes. 
He does not smoke , and he does not drink. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , tan male in no acute distress. 
Neck was supple , with no lymphadenopathy. 
Carotids were 2+ , with no bruits. 
Back examination demonstrated no costovertebral angle tenderness and no spinal tenderness. 
Coronary examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm , distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema , with pulses 2+ throughout , and no femoral bruits. 
Chest x-ray showed no enlarged heart and no infiltrate. 
In addition , an electrocardiogram was performed , which showed a left ventricle with 73% ejection fraction , upper limits of normal size , and a question of inferior wall hypokinesis. 
Because of a positive ETT , the patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed a proximal left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which was percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to 20% residual , as well as a mid-left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which was percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to a 30% residual. 
The left anterior descending was found to be diffusely diseased , without focal stenoses , and the proximal right coronary artery showed a 60% shelf-like lesion. 
The patient did not experience chest pain or shortness of breath during the procedure. 
Post cardiac catheterization/percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplasty , the patient was maintained on his glipizide and atenolol , 50 mg p.o. q.d. , and enteric-coated aspirin , as well as heparin overnight. 
Two days after the cardiac catheterization , the patient underwent a second submax ETT. 
This he performed without chest discomfort or electrocardiogram changes. 
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will receive diabetic teaching as an outpatient with CHH and will follow up with Dr. Theiling .

After the procedure , the patient was admitted to the CCU with atrial flutter with RVR and a rate in the 20s. 
For the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was dual-paced without any recurrence of arrhythmias. 
On admission , the patient had indications of heart failure , including increased JVP and bilateral lower extremity edema , as well as pulmonary effusions. 
In addition , the patient was noted to have marked hypertension throughout his stay. 
The patient's blood pressure was managed with calcium channel blocker , beta-blocker , as well as ACE inhibitor. 
However , the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2/25/05 which showed evidence of coronary artery disease , two-vessel disease , specifically , there was a LAD proximal 90% lesion as well as diffuse proximal-mid standing 80% lesion , as well as RTLV-BR mid discrete 80% lesion beyond the bifurcation of RPDA. 
The patient denied a chest pain throughout his stay. 
Upon discharge , he was able to ambulate without significant dyspnea on exertion or chest discomfort. 
2. Psychiatry: At the beginning of the hospital stay , the patient was confused and somewhat agitated. 
3. Vascular: Following the cardiac catheterization , the patient was noted to have a right femoral bruit. 
In addition , the patient was noted to have mildly elevated fasting blood glucoses during his admission. 
His hematocrit remained stable , with no signs of anemia. 
7. FEN: Due to the patient's heart failure , he was placed on a 2-liter fluid restriction as well as 2 g salt restriction. 
Due to his mild sedation with Haldol , the patient was evaluated by speech and swallow and initially placed on mechanical soft diet with some honey-thick liquids. 
As his mental status improved significantly , the patient was returned to a house diet , low-cholesterol , low-fat , with the previous salt and fluid restrictions. 
The patient remained afebrile , with no signs of systemic infection throughout his stay. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON DISCHARGE: General: This is a pleasant elderly female in no acute distress , alert and oriented x3.

HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
ABDOMEN: Obese , positive bowel sounds , and non-tender with a small fascial defect at the umbilicus and a well healed midline scar. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 7l beats per minute with an axis of positive 40 degrees , normal intervals , and no ischemic changes. 
Patient was placed under general anesthesia and her intubation was particularly difficult secondary to obesity requiring fiberoptic intubation and Anesthesia elected , at this time , to place both an A-line and a central venous access in order to be able to optimally monitor this difficult obese patient. 
Patient then underwent a very uncomplicated cholecystectomy at which time a distended gallbladder with several stones was found. 
Her O2 saturation on 40% facemask was 96% in the Recovery Room and both her nasogastric tube and Foley tube were removed without incident.

However , the Radiation/Oncology Service saw and followed Ms. Famiglietti over the course of this admission and felt very strongly that the changes were not consistent with prior radiation therapy. 
Further workup consisted of a bone scan which was negative , a chest CAT scan which revealed only thick skin on the left breast , no adenopathy , and minimal lung fibrosis. 
Of note is that the patient had no fever or elevated white count over the course of this admission. 
Serosanguineous fluid was aspirated from the collection and gram stain of the fluid revealed no polys and no organisms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wrich is a 67-year-old man with cardiac risk factors including hypertension , hypercholesterolemia. His CAD history begins one year ago when he began to experience resting jaw pain responsive to two to three sprays of nitroglycerin. 
After the catheterization , he had six weeks without pain but over the last two weeks he had begun to experience increasing jaw pain that was minimally responsive to nitroglycerin spray. 
He had taken aspirin a few times in his 20s and 30s without any recalled side effects. 
He lives with his wife and performs clerical work and can perform activities of daily living without issue. 
His abdomen was soft , nontender with two ventral hernias without issue. 
Mr. Botts cardiac catheterization went smoothly with identified 70% mid proximal LAD lesion and proximal 40% RCA lesion. 
His beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were held for anticipation of aspirin desensitization. 
He did not experience any further chest pain or jaw pain during his stay and was stable hemodynamically. 
Given his vague history of possible aspirin allergy and question of anaphylactic shock induced by NSAIDs , it was decided to desensitize him to 81 mg of aspirin. 
Epinephrine and Benadryl were kept at bedside but were not required because he had no adverse reaction to any of the doses. 
He was instructed that it was important to take his aspirin every day because if he missed a dose he may have an allergic reaction that his desensitization was designed to avoid.

Patient's lungs were noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
A well-healed right CEA scar was noted on the patient's neck. 
Patient's heart was noted to have a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Patient's abdomen was noted to be soft , nondistended and nontender. 
The left side was noted to be normal. 
The left foot was noted to have two small clean ulcers , one on the medial bunion and one on the tip of the medial great toe. 
The right foot was noted to have a large dark necrotic pressure wound on the lateral aspect and plantar aspect of the mid foot , an open infected-appearing ulcer was noted on the medial forefoot with surrounding erythema and a greenish exudate of film. 
Right popliteal biphasic Doppler pulses noted. 
The left foot was noted to have biphasic signals in the DP and PT by Doppler. 
X-ray of the feet demonstrated bilateral osteopenia with no evidence of osteomyelitis in either foot. 
EKG was noted to be normal with a normal sinus rhythm at 63. HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. 
The patient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid for previously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to be discontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  
A distal stenosis of the external iliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. 
The patient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the access site but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards. 
Following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , the patient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremity DP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration of her hospital course. 
For a detailed description of the patient's operative procedure , please the relevant operative note. 
The ulcers on the lateral right foot were not debrided at this time. 
Her operative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staph which was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. 
At this point , the patient's VAC dressing was changed to demonstrate a well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulation tissue and no signs of wound necrosis. 
For a detailed description of this operative procedure , please see the relevant operative note. 
A fair amount of her pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer; however , the patient was also noted to have significant pain associated with her contracted right lower extremity.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Approximately two days prior to presentation , while preparing to return to bed , the patient noted decrease feeling in her right leg and right arm clumsiness. 
This event was felt to be different from her usual paralysis ( she had had similar symptoms of this before and had waited for it to resolve ) , except that this event had lasted greater than 24 hours and she also began to notice dysarthria. 
She had not taken insulin for several days , but has had decreased p.o. intake secondary to her inability to move. 
Of note , she had difficulty swallowing on the morning of admission. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She had no fevers , chills , vomiting or loss of consciousness. 
No chest pain or shortness of breath , no photophobia or neck stiffness. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of diabetes mellitus , multinodular goiter , hypertension , anemia and sickle cell trait , status post total abdominal hysterectomy , history of cervical dysplasia , bursitis and multiple musculoskeletal complaints , just a history of physical abuse and vitiligo , hemorrhoids. 
No clear history of tobacco or ethanol use. 
She cannot shrug her right shoulder. 
Gait not assessed. 
Abdomen: Soft and nontender. 
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 104 per report when compared with EKG of January , no significant change. 
Otherwise , no significant abnormality was seen. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Mina is a 57-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , multinodular goiter , arthritis and questionable recurrent bouts of generalized weakness who was admitted for new onset of right sided weakness ( three days prior to admission ) , right leg numbness and weakness , right arm clumsiness followed by dysarthria. 
In addition , given her history , the team was unable to rule out the possibility of an embolic event. 
Therefore , the patient was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
She was placed on a cardiac monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia. 
Other than nonspecific septal abnormality , there was no evidence of regional wall motion dysfunction. 
Trileaflet aortic valve without dysfunction. 
Peak doppler flow velocity across the tricuspid valve reached 2.5 meters per second consistent with normal right heart systolic pressures. 
There was no evidence of effusion. 
In addition , the patient underwent carotid noninvasive studies which revealed no evidence of hemodynamically significant disease in either carotid artery with those arteries having minimal plaque and 1-25% stenosis. 
A similar smaller area of signal abnormality was noted in the left globus pallidus adjacent to the left internal capsule abnormality. 
There was no other signal abnormality noted. 
Major vascular flow voids were normal. 
There was no mass or mass effect. 
Three D , TOF MRN angiogram on the circle of Willis and its major tributaries did not demonstrate any abnormality. 
Incidental note was made of a dominant right vertebral artery. 
The stroke service was asked to comment on the possibility of a vasculitic process. 
The patient's primary rheumatologist felt that the patient's stroke was most likely due to small vessel disease associated with diabetes and hypertension. 
He felt there was no evidence for a vasculitis. 
He therefore suggested to continue aspirin , but in higher doses to alleviate her left shoulder pain. 
The patient did not feel that she had any vasculitic process. 
In addition to continuing the patient on aspirin , continuing subcu heparin while the patient was immobile , the patient's antihypertensives were held in order to maintain a systolic blood pressure between 140-160 and a diastolic blood pressure between 85-90 for the first ten days following her stroke. 
For the first few days , the patient was kept in a lying position as much as possible and her activity level was gradually increased to the point where she was participating in full PT/OT. 
It should not be reinitiated until roughly ten days after her stroke. 
Therefore when her medical issues were stable , she was considered ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility in an attempt to further improve her neurologic function. 
As noted previously , the patient's antihypertensives should be reinitiated gradually with a goal systolic blood pressure between 140-160 with a diastolic blood pressure of 85-90 to be initiated roughly ten days from the time of her stroke ( presented on 8/17/98 ). 
As noted by the work up , the patient had no evidence of an embolic source for her stroke and her carotid studies were unremarkable. 
2. RHEUMATOLOGIC: As noted , the patient has a long history of diffuse arthritic complaints. 
Rheumatology was consulted who felt that her stroke was not consistent with a vascular process. 
Her urinalysis showed no protein , no blood , 0-2 red blood cells , no casts. 
Only other recommendation was to continue aspirin and consider higher doses to alleviate left shoulder pain. 
In addition , recommended avoiding nonsteroidals while the patient was on aspirin. 
3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and had not taken her insulin for several days prior to admission. 
He died several years ago and no further abuse history could be elicited since his death. 
The patient was considered stable and ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

He is 13 years' status post bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and also has a history of afib with diastolic heart failure and a permanent pacemaker , on Coumadin therapy. 
He was admitted to Tson Community Hospital following a fall to the ground where he was found to be febrile with leukocytosis and there was a question of left lower lobe infiltrate. 
PE was performed , which was negative for vegetation , but the patient's oxygen requirement increased and his blood pressure seemed to be dropping , and thus he was transferred to Petersram Medical Center for further workup and management. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Afib , hypertension , diastolic dysfunction , echo in 1999 with moderate concentric LVH and EF of 65% , right heart catheterization in 2000 showed elevated right heart filling pressures and wedge pressure which increased with exercise , cardiac output of 4.4 , status post 27-mm bioprosthetic AVR and ascending two grafts in 1992 , afib with diastolic heart failure , left bundle-branch block , permanent pacemaker , hypothyroidism , type II diabetes , obesity , distant cholecystectomy , AAA , status post repair ( ? ) , thrombocytopenia , gout , prostate cancer , status post hormone therapy , and diabetes mellitus. 
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were lisinopril 5 q.o.d. , allopurinol 100 b.i.d. , glyburide 6.25 q. day , levothyroxine 100 , Zoloft 50 , Protonix 40 , Lasix 60 , and Coumadin 2.5. 
He was in an irregular S1 , normal S2 with no rubs or gallops. 
He was oriented to person , time , and generally to place , but not to date. 
Chest x-ray on admission showed a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate by report. 
It also revealed a left pleural effusion with a question of infiltrate and a right pleural effusion. 
Echo done at the bedside shows an EF of approximately 45% to 50% without gross regional wall motion abnormalities with some paradoxical motion consistent with left bundle-branch block. 
There is no obvious vegetation , but this was a limited study. 
Remainder of hospital course by system: 1. ID: The patient had repeated Gram-positive bacteremia with MSSA up until the January , 2005 , after which time his daily cultures have shown no growth to date. 
Daily blood cultures do not need to be resumed unless the patient has a temperature at which point he should be cultured. 
We did not do a TEE as the patient is likely not a surgical candidate and he was felt to be at very high risk of intubation , should he become septic again or spike temperatures this would be reconsidered. 
After the patient's blood pressure improved , we started him on a low-dose beta-blocker , which he should continue. 
Pump: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and an EF of 40%. 
But , he had a normal rate while inhouse especially while on beta-blocker. 
4. Endo: The patient is with diabetes. 
The patient benefits from regular reorientation which we suggest continuing.

Skin revealed blanching macular rash confined largely to the trunk without splinter hemorrhages , Janeway's nodes or Osler's nodes. 
Extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema. 
Chest x-ray showed a questionable lingular infiltrate that was read as such by one radiologist but this was not confirmed by a second radiologist. 
There was no sign of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray. 
However , it was felt that endocarditis a small though real possibility in this gentleman with AVR.

Surveillance blood cultures with fungal isolators were sent on a daily basis while in the hospital , all of which have come back negative to date. 
She was evaluated by Ophthalmology to rule out endophthalmitis and was determined not to have evidence of this. 
She also received a transthoracic echocardiogram to rule out vegetation. 
All subsequent blood cultures from 9/27/07 and 2/28/07 are all negative to date. 
She also had a repeat chest x-ray which showed only minimal atelectasis and no evidence of pneumonia. 
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and to rule out biliary obstruction. 
A gallbladder with a few small stones as well as sludge , gallbladder wall thickness was normal. 
There was no sonographic Murphy's sign , and biliary tree was noted to have a dilated common bile duct of 7 mm that was unchanged and distal ducts were not well seen. 
She did not have any episodes of rapid ventricular rate , nor any episodes of hemodynamic instability or hypertension. 
Approximately , 50% of the sutures , however , were not ready to come out , and the patient should follow up with Dr. Rossie K Mankoski on 1/12/07 for removal of the remaining sutures. 
She , however , has not had any epistaxis during this admission. 
Of note , phosphate should not be repleted with Neutrophos but with sodium phosphate for phosphates less than 1.5 possibly given the potassium load and Neutrophos. 
GENERAL: On general exam , the patient is no acute distress. 
Abdomen is obese , soft , nondistended and nontender. 
There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. 
EXTREMITIES: There is trace edema of the right lower extremity at the shin and no edema of the left lower extremity. 
She should also go to her follow-up appointment with Dr. Rossie K Mankoski from Orthopedics on 1/12/07 at 9:45 a.m. for evaluation of her sutures and possible removal at that time.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac amyloidosis , hypertension , coronary artery disease , left popliteal DVT. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75-year-old  African-American woman with chronic renal insufficiency , coronary artery disease , and diabetes and recent admissions for syncope who was admitted after being found unresponsive and blue with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s in the bathroom of her nursing home. 
Her systolic blood pressure came up to 100 without intervention , but she was sent to A Salt Medical Center ER for further evaluation. 
She was given Lovenox , Zofran , and aspirin and admitted for further management. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , diabetes , cerebrovascular accidents , cortical blindness , hypertension , anemia , monoclonal gammopathy , left upper extremity thrombophlebitis. 
Her chest was clear to auscultation but decreased breath sounds on her right base were noted. 
Abdomen was soft with bowel sounds , nontender. 
Multiple chest x-rays showed unchanged right pleural effusion , which was small and not amenable for thoracentesis. 
ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minutes , low voltage , incomplete right bundle-branch block , left axis deviation , Q-waves inferior and anterior , no ST depressions or elevations. 
This was no significant change from EKG that was done on 2/3/05 .  
This was initially thought to be consistent with a non ST elevation. 
However , patient had no EKG changes. 
It was also noted that the patient had similar elevations of her troponin and was recently admitted to an outside hospital. 
On 10/21/05 , the patient had an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 30s of unknown etiology. 
She was given IV fluids , dexamethasone 4 mg and one dose of gentamicin and vancomycin for presumed sepsis. 
There were wall motion abnormalities that were noted. 
The patient was given additional doses of intravenous fluids and her blood pressures came back to 120s-130s/60s-70s. 
At this point , the etiology of her low blood pressure was still unknown. 
On 2/16 , patient was again unresponsive with low blood pressure and no pulse. 
The patient was thought to have autonomic insufficiency secondary to amyloid neuropathy and a fixed cardiac output with restrictive heart. 
Serum protein analysis subsequently revealed a predominance of IgG light chains with elevation of both kappa and lambda light change , which are suggestive but not confirmatory of type AL amyloidosis. 
Of note , the patient had no further hypotensive episodes prior to discharge. 
2. Hematology: The patient was noted to have a low platelet count of 136 , 000 at admission. 
It was thought that this could be due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but the hep antibody was negative. 
The patient was started on heparin intravenous according to protocol. 
On 10/12/05 , the patient had nosebleeds and hematuria and her PTT was noted to be greater than 150. 
She was later switched to Lovenox and Coumadin maintaining her INR between 2 and 3. Lovenox was discontinued and on discharge the patient was just on Coumadin. 
There were no acute renal issues. 
5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. 
She had normal fingersticks during her hospitalization. 
Nutrition was consulted and she was placed on a soft pureed diet with a 2-L fluid restriction , no concentrated sweets. 
9. Disposition: There was a family meeting on 1/22/05 during which the patient's poor prognosis was discussed with Ms. Penny O Rizas , the patient's daughter.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55 year old right handed woman with a history of diabetes on Insulin for three years , hypertension , question of migraine headaches for more than ten years , and question of benign positional vertigo admitted with blurred vision , light headedness , and slurred and slowed speech since early the morning of presentation and substernal chest pain times two weeks intermittently. 
Patient had a greater than ten year history of headaches , usually unilateral although alternating between left and right , frontal and occipital , throbbing , and usually without visual changes , possible migraine. 
The morning of presentation , she awoke and then when she tried to sit up , felt light headed but without loss of consciousness. 
Then , when she tried to talk , she noted slurred and slow speech although she understood , had positive word-finding , no aphasia , no wheakness , no numbness , or other sensory changes. 
The patient has also been complaining of substernal chest pain in the center of her chest , dull without radiation , intermittently times two weeks , usually moderate in intensity , lasting about hours with no precipitating factors noted , and occurred regardless of activity level , even at rest associated with mild shortness of breath , no diaphoresis , and no increased nausea or vomiting. 
She did have chest pain and had received two sublingual Nitroglycerins without relief , Maalox with some relief of that pain , and there were no EKG changes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus on oral hypoglycemic times one year and then Insulin times three years diagnosed as gestational diabetes at first approximately more then twenty years ago. 
She also has a history of a hypertension , question of benign positional vertigo , cervical radiculopathy , bilateral carpal-tunnel syndrome , borderline personality with a history of major depression , thalassemia trait , gastroesophageal reflux disease , question of thyroid disease , chronic hepatic abdominal liver function test rise with a possible biopsy in 6/9 although results are not here , and question of migraines since the mid 1970s. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general , she was an obese black woman awake but very quiet and reserved but in no apparent distress. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction for the substernal chest pain although there was a low index of suspicion for heart attack. 
CHH Cardiology felt that this chest pain was not related to her heart or ischemic cause and left it up to the primary provider , Dr. Gruntz , to arrange for an out-patient exercise stress test if felt necessary. 
Most likely , the chest pain represented some type of gastroesophageal reflux disease and the patient was restarted on Axid. 
Another issue was question of new neurologic deficits although the original head CT showed no evidence of stroke. 
The stroke may have been too early to detect leaving diagnosis of either a new cerebrovascular accident , a manifestation of a seizure , or a conversion reaction secondary to her borderline personality. 
Her primary deficit remained the slowing of speech without actual slurring of speech and without any deficits in understanding or expression. 
Cell count was low not consistent with infection. 
A cardiac echo was also done which showed normal left ventricular function without any segmantal wall motion abnormalities , there was a question of left ventricular hypertrophy , and carotid dopplers were done which showed no significant disease in the internal carotid arteries , however , there was a mild left internal carotid artery plaque. 
It is recommended that the patient have Neurology follow-up next week , had a repeat CT of the head done to see whether ther is a new infarct , and also an EEG was recommended by the Neurology Consultation Servicer here for a question of seizures. 
Patient's chest X-Ray was also read as clear without any masses. 
Patient did have a cursory breast examination without any evidence of a breast mass and has had mammograms in the past without any evidence of malignancy. 
The etiology of the elevated calcium was unclear although leading diagnoses include primary hyperparathyroidism , prolonged immobilization , or lying in bed with some leeching of calcium versus a possible malignancy. 
She did have a PTH level drawn during this admission , the results were not back at the time of discharge , however , this level should be checked upon her next visit.

In the Emergency Department , the patient became progressively lethargic and an arterial blood gas there revealed hypoventilation , presumed secondary to obesity and the patient's congestive heart failure. 
It seemed that the combination of congestive heart failure and poor baseline respiration , secondary to body habitus , led to this acute worsening. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history included Adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy , hypertension , diabetes , sarcoid left breast cancer , hypercholesterolemia , deep venous thromboses , OSA , and coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarctions x 2. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Dulcolax 5-10 mg p.o. q. day p.r.n. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin DM 10 ml q. 4 hours p.r.n. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.i.d. , insulin NPH 30 mg subcutaneously b.i.d. , Zestril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Maalox , Milk and Magnesia , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. , Senna tablets p.r.n. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day , Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , oxycontin 10 mg p.o. q. 12 hours , oxycodone 5-10 mg q. 6 hours p.r.n. pain , and Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q. day. 
The patient denied a history of tobacco or alcohol use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination revealed the patient to be an obese woman with vital signs revealing temperature 96 , pulse 93 , blood pressure 115/60 , respiratory rate 24 , and saturations 78% on 1.5 liters of oxygen , with 97% on 4 liters of oxygen. 
HEENT examination showed no jugular venous distention. 
There was no lymphadenopathy and no carotid bruits. 
Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur , rub , or gallop. 
The abdomen was non-distended and non-tender , obese , firm , and with hypoactive bowel sounds. 
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed sodium 140 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 99 , bicarb 34 , BUN 32 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 40 , white count 8.2 , hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 241 , ALT 32 , AST 65 , LDH 717 , CK 436 , with an MB fraction of 5.4 , troponin I 0.22 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , alkaline phosphatase 381 , digoxin 1.8 , calcium 9.4 , and albumin 4.1.

A urinalysis showed no protein , 2+ blood , 5-10 red blood cells , and 1+ squamous epithelial cells. 
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm in the 80s , low voltage , with no change from previous studies. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for diuresis and continued BIPAP. 
However , the patient did not tolerate BIPAP , but diuresed well , in fact , too well , to intravenous boluses of Lasix , with urine output of 7 liters negative in one day , on May , followed by ventilatory failure on May , with bicarb greater than assay. 
The patient began spiking temperatures on May , as well , and was started on a regimen of levofloxacin and clindamycin on September for the question of aspiration pneumonia. 
Other issues in the patient's hospitalization have included hypernatremia , thought secondary to the patient's receiving large amounts of Lasix and having no access to free water. 
The patient also had prerenal azotemia , which was improving at the time of discharge , as well as coronary artery disease , which was not an issue , and fluid overload , secondary to cardiomyopathy , which was much improved. 
The patient's chest CT scan also showed significant lymphadenopathy , which was noted prior , and was thought to be secondary to sarcoid , which was recurrent CA , at this point , given that there was no biopsy data. 
The patient was also supplemented with tube feeds , as well as Promod protein supplements , during the course of her admission.

OTHER DIAGNOSES: End-stage renal disease , coronary artery disease , status post CABG , VT , status post ICD placement , peripheral vascular disease , history of CVA with residual right-sided weakness , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , low back pain , and peripheral neuropathy. 
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with history of severe and operable coronary artery disease , status post CABG , history of ventricular tachycardia , status post ICD placement who is on amiodarone , end stage renal disease on hemodialysis , status post CVA , who presents with chest pain and a report of a syncopal episode. 
He reports no palpitations or chest pain prior to the event and believes that he may have been unconscious for 20 minutes. 
Talking to the family , the patient was actually attempting to throw something at this son , fell , and had no loss of consciousness after falling. 
He denies any recent change in chronic shortness of breath or exercise capacity , orthopnea , or increased edema. 
Upon admission to the medical team , his vital signs were stable and he denied chest pain. 
He was admitted to rule out myocardial infarction. 
He was continued on aspirin products and beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor , and amiodarone. 
The patient is not on a statin though he has been in the past; he reports that he had some sort of a reaction to the medication. 
Cardiology was consulted and felt that the frequency of the pain , the rapid onset and offset , and the reproducibility of the pain to palpation made angina less likely; they did not feel that catheterization or further workup was indicated. 
2. Cardiovascular pump function: Initially , the patient was dry on exam , and demonstrated no signs or symptoms of heart failure. 
There was concern that possible arrhythmia or pacer malfunction could have been the cause of his symptoms. 
The electrophysiology team was consulted and pacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well , with no history of arrhythmia or alarm. 
They reported concern that did not want the patient to return home because of abusive and erratic behavior by the patient. 
Psychiatry did see the patient and felt that he was unreliable and was probably not safe to go home to take care of himself , but that he was also confident to make decisions and was not acutely psychotic , and therefore , it should not be committed against his will. 
The patient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. 
The situation was discussed with the patient's primary doctor , with the family over the phone , as they would not come in for a family meeting with the patient and he did go home , but will likely require a psych follow up as an outpatient. 
6. Endocrine: The patient continued on insulin and Regular Insulin sliding scale for his history of diabetes.

ABDOMEN: Examination was large and obese with a ventral supraumbilical hernia with an indistinct fascial edge , partially reduced but possibly with a second aspect just above the umbilical hernia , a 5-6 cm mass which was non-reducible , faint bowel sounds with diffuse tenderness. 
Of note , she had 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses and her posterior tibial pulses were not palpable. 
Her left calf was tender which the patient reported to be chronic and her entire calf was firm with no cords palpable. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was non-focal. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , question of poor R wave progression , no ST or T wave changes , and her chest X-Ray was clear with no active disease. 
That operation was notable to be a reducible umbilical hernia which was noted to be incarcerated without any evidence of strangulation. 
She also underwent a rule out myocardial infarction protocol post-operatively and did rule out. 
Of note , the right calf had a palpable cord , lower extremity non-invasives were scheduled , and the Cardiology Deep Venous Thrombosis Service was consulted. 
They felt that her left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis was chronic deep venous thrombosis and venous insufficiency. 
She was additionally seen by the Pulmonary Service who suggested getting pulmonary function tests once the patient was clinically stable and agreed to using Ted thigh-high stockings. 
She had an echocardiogram to rule out evidence of pulmonary hypertension in the setting of sleep apnea felt the most likely diagnosis in this pickwickian appearing patient. 
Her echo was without evidence of pulmonary hypertension. 
Given that she had had a mesh placed , she was started on antibiotic prophylaxis for possible cellulitis. 
The Deep Venous Thrombosis Cardiology Service recommended repeating her lower extremity non-invasives prior to discharge , continuing her on her 30 to 40 mm of mercury stockings during the day , and Teds at night. 
She had a follow-up lower extremity non-invasive on the day of discharge which showed a chronic left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis with venous insufficiency and no evidence of new deep venous thrombosis. 
They recommended follow-up lower extremity non-invasives after discharge as an out-patient. 
She has scheduled follow-up in the Surgical Clinic January , ten days after discharge , for follow-up of her chronic venous insufficiency in KTDUOO and the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Knerr on March to further evaluate her sleep apnea oxygen requirements.

RECORD #127
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , and with no known hx of CAD admitted with chest pain. 
It is sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath without nausea and occasional diaphoresis. 
She was seen in the Emergency Department with chest pain on June , 1997 , with negative troponins and negative cardiac enzymes. 
This study was interpreted as consistent with , but not diagnostic ischemia. 
On the morning of admission , she was walking to catch a bus and had an episode of substernal chest burning lasting less than 10 minutes with shortness of breath , but no nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. 
She denied lower extremity edema and had mild orthopnea which was unchanged. 
She denied bright red blood per rectum , and stools were black secondary to iron supplementation. 
6 ) Adult onset diabetes mellitus , diet-controlled. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant female in no acute distress. 
Carotids were 2+ bilaterally , no bruits. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Tollett was admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction protocol and underwent serial electrocardiograms and her enzymes were studied. 
Given her low hematocrit as a possible etiology for her ischemia , she was transfused with one unit of packed red cells. 
On February , 1997 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a 70% residual osteal diagonal stenosis , 0% left anterior descending stenosis. 
Following her two cardiac catheterizations , she experienced intermittent atypical chest which was transient in nature without sustaining any electrocardiogram changes. 
She had an exercise tolerance test and ED study on June , 1997 , which showed an essentially negative exercise treadmill test and was a suboptimal study. 
She exercised for approximately five minutes on submaximal exercise treadmill test protocol with no evidence of ischemia , but low exercise tolerance.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Breisch is a 50-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease significant for an 80% mid circumflex , 95% mid right , 70% distal right , 50% distal left anterior descending coronary artery lesions with posterobasilar hypokinesis in the setting of a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction , hypertension times greater than 30 years , and an elevated cholesterol who was in his normal state of health until the morning of admission. 
The pain did not radiate. 
He denies dizziness , shortness of breath , palpitations , and diaphoresis. 
The patient sat down and , this time , the pain resolved without sublingual nitroglycerin in approximately three minutes. 
One hour later , in A Salt Medical Center Emergency Room , the patient suffered a similar episode of chest pain and tightness , this time rated at 1/10 , with resolution of pain in approximately one minute , not requiring sublingual nitroglycerin. 
Review of symptoms is consistent with above and , otherwise , noncontributory. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease diagnosed in 1994 with catheterization performed in April 1994. 
3. Hypercholesterolemia. 4. Hepatitis in 1991 , believed to be of a viral type with complete resolution of symptoms and no sequela. 
The exercise tolerance test proceeded without chest pain. 
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. 2. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day. 
There is no history of diabetes mellitus or cancer. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies current tobacco use. 
The patient denies alcohol use. 
They have no children. 
The patient reports that he is now on a low cholesterol diet , has lost 100 lb over the last two years , and was successfully walking four to five miles a day without chest pain or other symptoms until the day prior to admission. 
Generally , Mr. Breisch was an alert , well appearing man in no apparent distress. 
He was eager to answer our questions. 
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat examination was significant only for exanthema under the right eye. 
The patient's neck was supple with full range of motion and no lymphadenopathy. 
The patient had jugular venous distention of 6 cm with the head of the bed elevated at 15 degrees. 
Heart examination was significant for normal S1 and S2 , and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur that was heard best at the lower left sternal border , although it was audible at the right sternal border , left mid axillary line , and appeared to radiate to the carotids. 
The patient's extremities were clear of cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
The patient was guaiac negative by report was normal tone. 
Neurologic examination was nonfocal and significant for the patient being alert and oriented times three , with a motor examination showing 5/5 strength throughout. 
LABORATORY DATA: The patient was found to have normal electrolytes. 
At Lovelin Medical Center , the patient had an EKG taken that was significant for normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute with intervals of 169/93/402 with no Q waves , no ST changes. 
An EKG obtained at A Salt Medical Center showed normal sinus rhythm at 64 beats per minute with intervals of 172/100/412 with one PVC captured. 
However , there were no Q waves and no ST changes. 
However , the patient's severe coronary artery disease lead the interventional radiologists to consider the patient for a laser wire type of PTCA in the event that PTCA was not successful. 
As the laser wire PTCA was not available for several days , it was decided to have Mr. Breisch remain as an inpatient on heparin to maintain a PTT of 60-80 while awaiting the laser wire guided PTCA. 
The patient denied shortness of breath , palpitations , or diaphoresis. 
Since that time , the patient remained totally stable with no further events of chest pain and no EKG changes noted. 
On May , 1996 , five days after admission , the patient successfully underwent PTCA of his left circumflex artery which had previously had a 100% stenosis. 
Examination the following morning revealed no further bleeding , no hematoma , and good pulses distally , as well as a warm and dry left lower extremity. 
As the patient tolerated the procedure well and had no further complications , it was decided that the patient could be discharged the day following his catheterization , maintained on 250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.day. 
We suspect that Mr. Breisch will be able to return to his normal activities of daily living without any further disability.

RECORD #139
ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Hypotension , diabetes mellitus , esophagitis , congestive heart failure. 
She has also had some worsening diarrhea , for which she was prescribed Imodium , but because of ongoing issues with compliance , it was felt that she was not taking enough at home. 
During an outpatient visit with her cardiologist , her blood pressure was noted to be 90/50 , so her dose of atenolol and Lasix was decreased. 
Of note , the patient is status post a recent admission to PUO for digoxin toxicity , so this medication is now also on hold. 
Of note , the patient is not currently on Coumadin despite a history of atrial fibrillation due to a history of GI bleeding , possible interactions with her chemotherapy regimen , and ongoing issues with medication compliance. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Nausea/vomiting x several months , diarrhea approximately six times per day , worsening over the past week with green liquid stool , no blood in stool or vomit , no abdominal pain , no urinary symptoms. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic breast cancer ( diagnosed in 1999 , status post lumpectomy and lymph node dissection , formerly on numerous chemotherapy regimens including Adriamycin/cytoxan , Taxol , Taxotere/Herceptin , gemcitabine ) , atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , cholecystitis , diabetes mellitus , esophagitis. 
She has no history of tobacco or alcohol use. 
General: Alert , italian-speaking , no acute distress. 
CV: Irregularly irregular , S1 , S2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops. Abdomen: Soft , distended , mild tenderness to palpation in the lower quadrants bilaterally , slightly tympanitic , normoactive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities: Warm/well perfused , trace DP/PT pulses , no clubbing/cyanosis/edema , ulcer on left large toe , severely cracked and dry skin on hands and feet. 
From that point on , the patient had no nausea or vomiting , and she is currently tolerating a full diet. 
Of note , the patient also has other signs of Xeloda toxicity , including possible hepatotoxicity ( see below ) as well as severe cracking and drying of the skin on her hands and feet. 
2. Hepatitis: A CT performed on admission to evaluate for small bowel obstruction showed a significantly cirrhotic and fatty liver with no masses. 
Gastroenterology consult suggested a right upper quadrant ultrasound , which was negative for obstruction , a hepatic MRI , which also showed a cirrhotic and fatty liver , and also a diagnostic/therapeutic IR guided paracentesis , which drained 1 liter of sterile fluid. 
However , given concern for a tachy-brady syndrome , the possibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker was discussed. 
However , the patient did not have any recurrence of the junctional rhythm. 
However , on the three days prior to discharge , the patient had no events on telemetry , and her heart rate was stable in the 60s to 80s , with a blood pressure running from 90-100/50-60. 
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , and her metformin was held on admission secondary to an elevated creatinine. 
Given that she was n.p.o. for several days , she was not given any insulin and her blood sugars remained stable in the low 100s. 
Of note , the patient has a left toe ulcer , and was seen by orthopedic surgeries and outpatient totally before admission. 
As noted above , despite a history of atrial fibrillation , the patient is not on Coumadin at home secondary to poor med compliance. 
Nevertheless , her hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission and she did not require any transfusions. 
At one point , she was noted to have left upper extremity swelling greater than the right upper extremity , but an ultrasound was negative for DVT. 
As noted above , on discharge , the patient's INR was improving secondary to improved nutrition. 
She will be discharged without any anticoagulation at present , however this can be further reevaluated as an outpatient by her cardiologist and oncologist. 
The patient was previously on Vioxx at home for orthopedic pain related to her diabetes , however , given recent data suggesting possible cardiotoxic effects of Vioxx , this will be discontinued , and she will be sent home with oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. 
As noted above , the patient has other evidence of chemo toxicity as well , including significantly dried skin on her hands and feet. 
The patient's outpatient oncologist , Dr. Carmelita Toni , followed her closely during this admission , and she will follow up with the patient regarding possible changes to her chemotherapy regimen. 
9. Disposition: The patient was seen by the physical therapy service shortly before discharge , and they noted that she displayed difficulty even moving from the bed to the chair , which is significantly below her baseline of being able to ambulate independently. 
Of note , the patient's code status was established by her outpatient oncologist as DNR/DNI. 
General: Alert , no acute distress , icteric sclerae , and slightly jaundiced. 
CV: Irregularly irregular S1 , S2 , 1/6 SM at the left upper sternal border , no rubs/gallops. 
Prior to discharge from rehab , her medication regimen should be simplified as much as possible to prevent future confusion over her medications , as has happened in the past.

Discharge Date: 2/30/1996 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION , MOST LIKELY POST- PERICARDIOTOMY SYNDROME OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY , EMPIRICAL DIAGNOSIS HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Dalegowski is a 52-year-old woman status post mitral valve repair and CABG in 6/28 , as well as dilated cardiomyopathy , who presented in 5/24/95 with worsening shortness of breath and left pleural effusion , and for further evaluation and treatment of these symptoms. 
In 6/28 , she presented to Petersram Medical Center with history of progressive dyspnea and congestive heart failure noted at an outside hospital. 
NECK - supple with 2+ carotids and no bruits. 
No pulmonary edema , and no infiltrations. 
Cytology was sent on the patient , which also returned negative for malignant cells. 
She remains with RAO to sats greater than 95% for the remainder of her hospitalization and did not require oxygen. 
A repeat chest x-ray was done prior to discharge , and compared to post-thoracentesis , showed no significant accumulation of the left pleural effusion. 
Initially it was felt that the patient's symptoms might have some relationship to some element of congestive heart failure. 
Both carotid Dopplers revealed less than 25 stenosis bilaterally and MRA of the head revealed no vertebral basal insufficiency. 
An echocardiogram during this admission revealed an ejection fraction of 30% , moderate LV dilatation , severe global hyperkinesis , preserved right ventricular function and size , and only trivial MR and TR. No significant arrhythmias were noted on the patient's cardiac monitor throughout her hospitalization , except for one episode of transient third degree heart block with a ventricular rhythm. 
The patient did not demonstrate this rhythm consistently , however , during her hypertensive episodes. 
The next day the patient's symptoms resolved and she no longer had any evidence of orthostatic hypertension or dizziness symptoms related to standing or walking. 
The patient was therefore discharged in stable condition with diagnosis of a left pleural effusion secondary to most likely a post-pericardiotomy syndrome , as well as orthostatic hypertension and dizziness symptoms secondary to adrenal insufficiency. 
It remained unclear whether or not the patient's current ejection fraction was adequate for her symptoms. 
DISPOSITION: Patient was discharged home to Ton There were no complications during this admission. 
Patient was discharged in a stable condition , with no estimated disability.

Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded to lidocaine. 
PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles , II/VI SEM worse w/inc. 
HOSPITAL COURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac service. 
Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was suspicious for CAD. 
The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone. 
The initial plan was for the patient to also have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach , however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. 
A broad differential diagnosis for his heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be determined. 
The patient also presented w/an elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the hospitalization.

Discharge Date: 12/10/2005 ATTENDING: GORGLIONE , JEANNETTE MD PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS DURING THIS ADMISSION: Decompensated heart failure. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overload. 
The patient was readmitted on 10/29/05 with decompensated congestive heart failure. 
4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.4 to 2.4 ) , likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes , but concerned for renal artery stenosis based on the history. 
EKG showed Q waves in 2 , 3 and aVF with T-wave inversions ( old findings , no acute changes ). 
EKG at this time showed ST depressions in V4 through V6. 
The recommendation of the Cardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiac catheterization. 
The patient refused any intervention with cardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to her kidneys. 
She was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , and heparin was stopped on 7/6/05 with enzymes trending down , and no evidence of active ischemia. 
She was maintained on a low-dose beta-blocker until 7/11/05 .  
2. Pulmonary: The patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 liters secondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heart failure. 
The patient's IV diuretics were stopped on 6/12/05 in consideration of changing goals of care. 
3. Renal: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency was likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes. 
4. Endo: The patient's diabetes was controlled with Lantus insulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. 
There was concern for hypoglycemia on 6/12/05 in the setting with no oral intake. 
All of the patient's diabetic medications have been stopped at this time. 
5. Psychiatry: The Psychiatry consult team was consulted for major depressive disorder. 
Celexa was started for depression. 
The patient was able to make her own medical decisions at the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. 
She understood the risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. 
We will continue no psychiatric medications at the time of discharge.

Discharge Date: 1/17/2002 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease , hypertension , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , aortic stenosis , and status post bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts who presented to the hospital with increasing left lower extremity pain. 
He is most recently status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of 2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has been developing increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot to the point where he was not able to ambulate. 
In angiography , he was found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity vein graft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast and minimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot. 
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
This time they did not find necessarily any improvement. 
Based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patient was taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with Dr. Colasamte and Dr. Narvaez for an aortic valve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty with an Alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and left radial to posterior descending artery. 
Because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the Portland protocol and remained on a full ten-day course of Flagyl and Cefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. 
On postoperative day #1 he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able to ambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is not a candidate to go home immediately but a candidate for rehabilitation.

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , and 2+ mitral regurgitation. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post silent MI and cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , who has a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented with fatigue and shortness of breath. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , silent MI in 1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with GI bleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction previously reported at 20% in October 2005 , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation. 
Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco or illicit drugs. 
Abdomen: Nondistended , soft and nontender. 
Extremities: No edema , clubbing , or cyanosis. 
He underwent an echocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetation on the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. 
This question of a vegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and blood culture were sent. 
The patient's temperature had been low on admission , since there was some concern that he could be developing sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood cultures throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. 
He was seen by Cardiology , who did not think that this echo result required further intervention and suspected that it represented a flail tricuspid valve leaflet. 
The patient's troponin One troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and then another troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF and acute hepatitis. 
He recently had a negative stress echo at the Greene Lidonimill Medical Center , so no additional stress testing was pursued during this admission. 
He was switched to Lopressor 25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin was discontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalities which will be discussed below. 
His labs on morning were notable for a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9 to 25 ). 
He was empirically started on mucomyst and acyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenol toxicity or HSV. 
He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this was cancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. 
Cardiology did not think that any of this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stopped once his cultures were negative for multiple days. 
His tylenol level was normal and his hep seriologies were negative. 
His labs had all normalized by admission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward. 
3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question of vegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsis although that never panned out. 
He had a CT scan of his chest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. 
They were not positional in nature and resolved with verbal consolation and redirection and deep breath. 
His Valium had initially been initiated but it was held in the setting of abnormal LFTs. 
He had no further anxiety attacks after that. 
6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it was noted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady decline throughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. 
Based on this discrepancy another PF4 was sent which was borderline positive. 
As per the hematology consult , they felt that despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylactic anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in the future until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months. 
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Ramil is the patient's new PCP at the KTDUOO clinic at the Pagham University Of , he has an appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr. Catania was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m. ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until you are cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. 
He also had an elevated white blood cell count during the transaminitis and renal failure up to 28. Final blood culture , no growth from anaerobic medium. 
Urine culture , no growth. 
RADIOLOGIC DATA: Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no evidence of portal vein thrombosis. 
Portable chest x-ray on 10/27/05 showed the lung volumes considerably decreased from the previous exam on 9/29/05 .  
There is hazy opacity in the lower lung sounds particularly on the right suggesting mild edema. 
There also appears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is again noted. 
On 10/27/05 , CAT scan of the abdomen showed no apparent source of infection , no collection or abscess , limited study secondary to lack of IV contrast , mild ascites , bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left with subsegmental atelectasis , presacral edema and cardiomegaly with left coronary artery calcification. 
CAT scan of the chest on 10/27/05 showed bilateral small pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema and small volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular ground glass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis but somewhat discrete , cannot exclude septic emboli but would be very localized. 
A head CT on 9/29/05 showed no acute intracranial abnormality.

Prior to this admission , the patient was at baseline Class III heart failure with dyspnea on exertion at about 20 feet. 
Following the CHF admission , the patient is on 2 liter home O2 and stated she had been stable for about a week , but able to do her chores with 2 liter O2. Had been fully at home VNA and saw her PCP on the day prior to admission without any change in her status. 
On the night prior to admission , however , she stated she had heart raising and could not sleep. 
Overnight , she had increased shortness of breath , but without any chest pain or lightheadedness.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is an 80 years old female with history of AFib and CHF , diastolic dysfunction with EF of 80% and COPD who was recently discharged for CHF w low dose lasix of 20mg now is found to be in CHF in a setting with suspected AFib with LVR. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Ischemia: There is no evidence of ischemia. 
The patient was ruled out with serial enzymes. 
She was continued on aspirin , no betablocker , and short acting diltiazem and statin. 
Her beta-blocker was initially not initiated , however , on three days prior to discharge , she was started on short-dose beta-blockade due to hypertension. 
We did not want to over diuresis the patient given her volume dependence and the diastolic dysfunction especially as we suspect that the heart failure is secondary to her rhythm , but not really significant volume overload. 
We also started her on short acting beta-blocker with Lopressor at 6.25 t.i.d. 
She was on 4 liter of oxygen on discharge and she will be self-weaned at home to 2 liter as possible.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Bartholomeu is a 71-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial flutter who started to develop shortness of breath , which worsened the night prior to admission. 
She also noted some jaw soreness , which she commonly feels with increased heart rate. 
Also when she gets up quickly , she continues to feel lightheaded but no loss of consciousness. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever , some nausea today , no vomiting , and little bit of diarrhea for one week but nonbloody. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , sick sinus syndrome with bradycardia status post a pacemaker placement in 1986. 
She has had high cholesterol. 
She has coronary artery disease status post an MI in 1992 , a CABG in 1992 , LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA. 
She has peripheral vascular disease. 
She has diabetes , status post cholecystectomy , status post pelvic floor suspension x2 , status post appendectomy and status post lysis of adhesions for bowel obstruction and colitis. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Digoxin 0.125 mg daily , lisinopril 5 mg daily , Pravachol 20 mg each night , diltiazem XR 360 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Asacol 1200 mg twice daily , cilostazol 50 mg twice daily , Toprol-XL 300 mg daily , Coumadin 2 mg daily , metformin 500 mg twice daily , nitroglycerin , lorazepam 0.25 mg in the morning and midday and then 0.5 mg at night , she does not take aspirin. 
No drinking currently but has in the past. 
General: She is in no acute distress , appears stated age. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Extremities: Warm and dry , no edema , and 1+ distal pulses. 
Labs were notable for a creatinine of 0.8 , and a hematocrit of 29.2. 
Chest x-ray on 10/2/2006 , later on admission showed improved pulmonary edema , slightly increased size of small effusions , and no infiltrate. 
She had a TTE with bubble study on 7/5/2006 , which showed no shunt , and an EF of 45%. 
2. Ischemia: She has a significant history of coronary artery disease. 
She did have the positive MIBI as discussed above , but given her significant previous interventions , the thought was to continue to manage her medically since this would not likely be amenable to intervention. 
She was not on any signs of decompensated CHF , although her shortness of breath did improve marginally with some gentle diuresis. 
She had no evidence of carbon monoxide , no methemoglobinemia. 
Pulmonary recommended a trial of Advair and Spiriva , if these made her feel better to continue these , if not then she could stop them. 
Also mentioned , she underwent a bubble study which showed no shunt. 
In sum , there was a question as to whether this may be related to atelectasis plus some underlying COPD plus her underlying small effusion.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old man with coronary artery today disease status post CABG , diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , status post bilateral below-the-knee amputations , end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , and metastatic prostate cancer presenting with new-onset ascites. 
He denies fevers , chills , jaundice , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or bright red blood per rectum. 
5. Coronary artery disease status post two-vessel CABG in 1991 and status post proximal RCA stents in 5/22 , EF of 50% to 55%. 6. Status post bilateral below-the-knee amputations secondary to diabetic ulcers. 
Currently , no alcohol and no illicit drugs. 
GENERAL: The patient is in no acute distress. 
SKIN: No rashes , no ecchymosis or petechiae. 
3. Chest x-ray , 1/5/2007: Low lung volume with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and no pneumonia. 
4. Finger films , 1/5/2007: Mild first carpometacarpal and scaphotrapeziotrapezoid osteoarthritis; otherwise unremarkable evaluation of the second digit. 
6. Repeat echocardiogram on 9/12/2007: Ejection fraction of 55% , no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
No significant change from prior study of 9/25/2007 .  
PROCEDURES: 9/25/2007 , therapeutic paracentesis , 4 liters of ascitic fluid removed without complication. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history of end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary artery disease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months of worsening ascites of unclear etiology. 
His hospital course by problem is as follows: 1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with total protein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradient greater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likely due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure. 
Therefore , it was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
Due to the difficulties with removing fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option of undergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine , but the patient and the family declined to participate in such care. 
It should also be noted that despite our efforts , the patient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were put into place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making it difficult to treat the patient's volume overload. 
As described above , ultrafiltration was attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possible and to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state. 
3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usual aspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgical revision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned. 
Pump: The patient has evidence of right heart failure by echocardiogram. 
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likely for fear of noncompliance. 
However , the patient refused further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker regimen. 
Plain films were obtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. 
A hand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that there were no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgent surgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. 
The patient's beta-blocker should be titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , coronary artery disease status post end-stomy , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia and gout. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily , Toprol 100 mg p.o. daily , Avapro 150 mg p.o. daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily , Lipitor 40 mg p.o. nightly , TriCor 48 mg p.o. daily , NPH 55 units in the morning , 34 units in the evening , NovoLog 8 units q.a.c. , allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily , Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , albuterol 2 puffs p.r.n. , Combivent p.r.n. , Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , multivitamin once per day , folate 1 mg p.o. daily and loratadine 10 mg p.o. daily. 
ALLERGIES: There are no known drug allergies. 
He is in no apparent distress. 
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
There are no rales. 
His abdomen is soft , obese , nontender and bowel sounds are present. 
Studies and echocardiogram from 7/21 shows an EF of 55-60% with no regional wall abnormalities. 
The patient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructive sleep apnea. 
He had not been compliant with CPAP as an outpatient. 
The patient was not felt to be clinically volume overloaded. 
The possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation was discussed at length with the patient and his wife who were extremely resistant to any other inpatient care. 
He is therefore discharged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup. 
This happened in the setting of continued auto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was due to a low flow state as result of heart failure rather than hypovolemia. 
He will follow up with vascular surgery as an outpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. 
He should not receive blood draws in the left upper extremity of avoidable. 
All cultures were no growth at the time of discharge. 
His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension and he is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of his antihypertensive medicines have not changed. 
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: He is in no apparent distress. 
Heart , regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes , rales or rhonchi. 
Abdomen is soft , obese , nontender , bowel sounds are present.

OTHER PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS TREATED: LGL NKA lymphoma with pancytopenia , type II diabetes , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , genital herpes , PICC line infection , nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. 
She also has a history of type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , and a recent herpes infection undergoing treatment with famciclovir who presented with fever , chills , cough , and decreased p.o. intake from her nursing home with moderate hypotension to systolic pressures of 80 at the nursing home as well as oxygen saturation of 91% and on admission was found to have fever without neutropenia later diagnosed with an MSSA bacteremia and a component of acute on chronic renal failure. 
ALLERGIES: Fentanyl which caused GI intolerance , lisinopril which causes cough , morphine which causes vomiting and Percocet which causes nausea and vomiting. 
A physical examination on admission was significant for tachycardia with an otherwise normal cardiac exam without murmurs. 
Her respiratory exam showed decreased air movement bilaterally with expiratory wheezes , however , no evidence of focal decrease in breath sounds. 
The chest x-ray was performed on admission that showed right-sided subsegmental basilar atelectasis with low lung volumes and a large cardiac silhouette , but no definitive infiltrate or fusion. 
She completed her course of famciclovir during hospitalization and had no further evidence of genital herpetic infection as well the urine culture and urinalysis data described above showed yeast only and a Foley that had been intermittently placed during the ED stay was discontinued , and the patient remained asymptomatic for any further urinary tract infection. 
Cardiovascular: Although the patient initially had transient hypertension believed to be secondary to infection and mild hypovolemia in the setting of diuretics and poor p.o. intake prior to coming in. 
Her metoprolol dose , which was initially 100 mg twice a day was changed the 62.5 mg four times daily , which can be converted as her blood pressure normalizes. 
Captopril and ARBs were not used due to her history of allergies but additional antihypertensive medications may be indicated if her pressure remains elevated. 
During the hospitalization , she had evidence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia asymptomatic on telemetry , however , with alteration of the dose of Lopressor there was no further evidence of this. 
There was no evidence of ischemia during the hospitalization. 
Pulmonary: Although she presented with some shortness of breath and cough she did not continue to have any shortness of breath or cough during the hospitalization. 
Due to complaints of right posterior rib pain during the hospitalization without evidence of any skin or soft tissue abnormalities she underwent a CT scan of the chest on 5/5/06 , which showed a small right middle lobe area of consolidation favoring atelectasis but not impossible to represent an early pneumonia. 
They also had tiny pleural effusions bilaterally as well as a tiny pericardial effusion , a small calcified right apical node , and an enlarged left thyroid lobe with extension below the sternum. 
There was no evidence of rib fracture or soft tissue abnormality on this CAT scan in the area of concern. 
The pain caused by this symptom , which is still unclear was treated with Lidoderm patch as well as Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 6h. standing with only modest relief. 
Other medications including other narcotics and NSAIDS were not used given her history of allergies as well as her thrombocytopenia. 
There is no inpatient treatment for this disease; however , she received transfusions of packed red blood cells for her hematocrit less than 22 and platelet scales were set as 10. 
Endocrine: This patient has a history of type II diabetes initially managed on Glucotrol in the outpatient setting. 
Her blood glucose is not optimally controlled but more aggressive attempts to control her glucose resulted in symptomatic hypoglycemia , therefore it was felt best to air on the side of mildly elevated blood glucoses in the range of 150 to the low 200s in order to avoid transient hypoglycemia. 
The patient was followed by physical therapy during the hospitalization and will continue to have physical therapy in the outpatient setting. 
There were no complications during the hospitalization. 
A cardiac exam with regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , no murmurs and abdominal exam showing obese abdomen with ventral hernia but otherwise benign and lower extremities with 1+ edema and nontender. 
A PICC line in the left upper extremity and no erythema in the right upper extremity , however , resolving induration and minimal tenderness. 
A white blood cell count of 1 , hematocrit of 22.5 , platelets of 13 with 1% polys , 86% lymphs , and 4% monocytes. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every six hours. 
Dr. Gaylene Faniel , her primary oncologist , has been notified of her discharge and will continue to follow her in the outpatient setting.

LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Altered mental status , metastatic adenocarcinoma , diabetes type 2 , history of sarcoid by report , status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of T9 through T12. 
The patient denies any fevers , chills , neck stiffness or focal neurologic symptoms. 
The Anesthesia Service called and pointed out that the Norap Valley Hospital MRI machine is not compatible with intubated patients. 
The patient was then transferred to Pagham University Of for possible MRI with intubation. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic adenocarcinoma , diabetes mellitus type 2 , history of sarcoid ( although never had a biopsy ) , status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of T9 , T11 and T12. 
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature of 98 degrees , heart rate 81 , blood pressure 107/51 , respirations 20 , sating 97% on 2 L. General exam showed a drowsy-feeling patient who was oriented x1 ( not for place or time ). 
HEENT exam shows pupils equal , round and reactive with no photophobia. 
Neck exam showed a supple neck with no lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiovascular exam showed a JVP that was difficult to assess , heart rate showed a regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops , distal pulses were bilateral and 2+ and symmetric. 
Abdominal exam showed an obese abdomen , is nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. 
The patient was poorly responsive to questions and commands , hence a motor and sensory exam was unable to be obtained , however , the patient was moving all extremities. 
Chest x-ray showed cardiac enlargement without acute or active disease. 
Head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality noted. 
Urinalysis showed trace leuk esterase , 5 to 10 white blood cells , 200 rbc's , however , urine culture showed no growth. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Neurologic: The patient was initially admitted to the medical ICU for possible MRI with intubation. 
However , upon arrival , the patient was alert and oriented enough to refuse the MRI/MRA ( this was desired to rule out metastatic disease versus leptomeningeal disease ). 
Because she did not require she was then sent to the floor on 2/11/06 .  
Hence , an MRI/MRA was not performed , as this would require the patient to undergo further sedation ( it was felt that her significant amount of benzodiazepines that were given previously only served to worsen her mental status ). 
An LP was not indicated at this time since she had returned to her baseline. 
An echo was ordered but was not performed secondary to the fact that the patient had had a previous echo within the last month , but was desired to rule the very small chance that she had marantic endocarditis with embolic phenomenon. 
The likely source of her altered mental status appears to be toxic metabolic multifactorial etiology , including the possibility of Zometa effect , the urinary tract infection and possible hypothyroidism. 
She should have her TFTs followed up as they are pending at this time for possible initiation of hormone replacement. 
5. ID: The patient finished a three-day course of ciprofloxacin for possible urinary tract infection , however , her urinary culture was negative. 
If her blood pressures are elevated at rehab , one could consider restarting her metoprolol. 
General exam shows a slightly obese female who is alert and oriented x4 in no acute distress. 
Cardiovascular exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Abdominal exam shows a slightly obese abdomen that is nondistended and nontender with good bowel sounds. 
Skin exam shows a midline back scar that is healing well and nontender with no erythema. 
Extremity exam shows no calf tenderness with trace edema.

PROCEDURES: 1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ). 2. Open cholecystectomy. 
He had nausea and one episode of nonbilious emesis. 
He denied fevers and chills. 
He was also seen by the surgical consult who felt that he did not have an acute abdomen. 
He then had a gastric emptying study , which showed only mildly delayed emptying and no reflux. 
Colchicine 0.3 mg as needed for gout. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke , use alcohol , or IV drug use. 
He is lying in bed , comfortable , in no acute distress. 
His oropharynx is clear without thrush , exudates , or erythema. 
His heart has a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
His abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended. 
There is no rebound or guarding. 
He has no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
Coagulation factors were within normal limits. 
Abdominal CT: 1. Ventral hernia containing nonobstructive transverse colon. 
EGD: Hypomotility of the stomach , no ulcerations , biopsies taken. 
Normal pylorus and normal duodenum. 
Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux. 
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , right bundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in the emergency department as well as consultations from the gastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient was thought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis given the findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasound and KUB. 
The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his diabetes. 
Surgery was reconsulted , and the patient was taken to the operating room where he had an exploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. 
An abdominal CT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess. 
They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further leak. 
He had no further pain. 
His Cartia was initially discontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but this was then restarted. 
Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral elbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout. 
A left elbow tap was attempted , but this did not return any fluid. 
The steroid taper was slowed and his gout improved. 
He was discharged without any elbow pain. 
His torsemide is dosed now at 40 mg q.a.m. 5. The patient will continue on Levaquin and Flagyl as prescribed for five days following discharge. 
3. Colchicine 0.3 mg orally daily as needed for gout.

ABDOMEN: Slightly distended , soft , and nontender with no guarding and positive bowel sounds. 
A chest x-ray showed unchanged coarse bilateral opacities with no acute process. 
The patient had no hypoglycemic episodes during this admission. 
Of note , the patient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home; however , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thought that this would not likely be the best regimen for her. 
The patient had recently completed a course of treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tenderness but did have distention. 
An abdominal ultrasound was obtained as a diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patient had an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasound revealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable to paracentesis. 
The patient did have an episode of confusion and delirium during this admission , which was felt to be likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. 
Of note , the patient was not started on Aldactone for management of her volume overload given that she was admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevated potassium. 
3. Neurologic: The patient had had one episode of delirium during this admission where she was confused , did not know where she was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately. 
The patient had a workup at that time , which included an infectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. 
Of note , the patient had no asterixis on discharge. 
The lisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given the patient's history of hyperkalemia and several episodes during this admission , which required the administration of Kayexalate. 
Of note , the patient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission. 
5. Pulmonary: The patient has history of IPF and had no acute pulmonary issues during this admission. 
The patient was afebrile and had no symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white count of 11 , 000.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35% and also a history of coronary artery disease status post MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease and chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overloaded. 
She denied any chest pain or other anginal equivalents. 
She quit tobacco with rare alcohol use and no drugs. 
In general , the patient was comfortable in no acute distress. 
Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm with a S3 and no murmur. 
Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema bilaterally to the hips with bilateral changes of arterial and venous insufficiency. 
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions , left greater than right with increased vascular markings and fluid in the right fissure , but no discrete infiltrates. 
IMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old woman with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , coronary artery disease status post MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , chronic renal insufficiency who presented in volume overload after a recent admission with insufficient diuresis. 
Her blood pressure was stable and she had no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organ perfusion. 
Her Lopressor was held for a decompensated heart failure. 
gradually up to 3.2; however , remained stable for the next few days and the patient was able to maintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her creatinine. 
She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at this admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the admission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events. 
In terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence of ischemia on presentation. 
She was followed by the MMC Renal Clinic with whom she has had a previous conversations about the possibility of hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after this discharge: 3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateral pleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. 
This was all felt to be consistent with her heart failure. 
She did have no signs or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging or as a part of her clinical picture. 
This was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over several hours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normal at 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. 
It was felt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of her injected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so , her Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbside consultation with the diabetes management service.

He also had ischemic cardiomyopathy with a known ejection of 20% and coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1993. 
He denied any fever. 
On admission , he was unable to walk more than 20 feet without becoming severely dyspneic. 
He does describe having diminished appetite , increased fatigue , and three days of copious watery stool , possibly related to his chemotherapy.

ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives at home and denies alcohol use. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient presented with exam and labs findings consistent with decompensated heart failure. 
The patient did have slight leak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG was unchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for the troponin , which did not trend to higher. 
His primary etiology , however , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart failure. 
He was therefore discharged home with oxygen to use overnight and when symptomatic. 3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrhea that was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has been completed two weeks earlier. 
His colchicine was initially held because of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flare of his gout in his right great toe. 
The patient received palliative stent to his esophagus on 4/5/05 that is placed by Dr. Ortmeier without complications. 
He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronounced than his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his gout in his right great toe. 
He no longer was tachypnic.

RECORD #205
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation , chronic renal insufficiency , and non-small cell carcinoma of the left lung , status post resection in 1997. 
Her denied headache , dizziness , chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal discomfort , or dysuria. 
Her denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. 
The effusions were likely secondary to congestive heart failure , although pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions could not be excluded. 
Given that he was afebrile with a decreasing white count and not increasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusions were considered less likely compared to worsening CHF. 
Given the concern for CHF , he was given Lasix 40 mg IV approximately one to two doses a day for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balance of 2 liters negative per day. 
The etiology of his congestive heart failure and pleural effusions was therefore thought to be atrial fibrillation with RVR. 
The patient was maintained on Coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along with Zocor and Questran for hyperlipidemia. 
In discussions with his outpatient cardiologist , it was thought that his T-wave inversions could possible be ischemic , although the appropriate course of action was not to pursue further anticoagulation or evaluation for catheterization , given the patient's other medical issues. 
His primary care physician and cardiologist should consider whether or not to restart digoxin as an outpatient. 
c. Pump: The patient was aggressively diuresed with 40 mg IV of Lasix approximately one to two times per day , for a total diuresis of roughly negative 9 liters over the course of his hospitalization. 
If these symptoms do not improve on the regimen within the few days following discharge from Petersram Medical Center , we will recommend consider adding metronidazole IV and getting an infectious disease consult. 
6. Musculoskeletal: Given the patient's creatinine clearance of less than 50 , his colchicine dose for gout was switched from 0.6 mg b.i.d. to 0.6 mg daily. 
We continued his Neurontin for neuropathic pain , and Tylenol for right knee osteoarthritis.

She was given a beta-blocker for surgery and has no signs of symptoms of ischemia throughout this hospitalization. 
This was difficulty to control with IV and p.o. beta-blocker , calcium channel blockers , and digoxin so she was IV amiodarone loaded and is currently undergoing a p.o. amiodarone load as well. 
Subsequently , she had increased her white blood cell count to 23 , but no fever.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: 1. Infectious disease: Ms. Balzano was admitted with fever and hypertension , and I was concerned for sepsis , I initially thought nosocomial pneumonia versus GI as the primary source. 
Her urine grew Enterococcus and she was changed to Levaquin only on 6/21/2005 to treat an enterococcal UTI and possible nosocomial pneumonia. 
She was afebrile over the last week and will stay and finish the 14-day course of Levaquin for UTI. 2. GI: Ms. Balzano was treated with bowel rest for her neutropenic enteritis and once she was no longer neutropenic without abdominal pain , she was started on clear liquid diet. 
Finally , after given sustained bowel rest , her blood stools resolved , and she was able to tolerate oral contrast and an abdominal CT on 9/6/2005 showed no small bowel wall thickening or any other intraabdominal process causing her symptoms. 
Her diet was advanced , and she was tolerating regular diet at the time of discharge without problems. 
Hematology was consulted secondary to suboptimal busted platelet levels status post transfusions , which was felt to be secondary to poor marrow response in the setting of recent chemo ( workup was negative for other possible causes refractory thrombocytopenia , nystatin , allopurinol , were held given possible worsening of her thrombocytopenia ). 
On discharge her hematocrit and platelets were stable respectively at 29.8 and 46 , 000 and she had not required a transfusion in greater than 24 hours prior to discharge.

Patient denies any chest pain , nausea , vomiting , palpitations or syncope. 
She does acknowledge sitting orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately 48 hours before admission , no lower extremity edema. 
She denies any changes in diet or changes in medical adherence. 
She was found to be hypertensive , hypoxic with clinical and chest radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure. 
The patient was in no acute distress , she is pleasant , a little overweight , alert and oriented times person , place and time. 
She had no lower extremity edema. 
She had cool extremities and neurologic exam , other than patient being alert and oriented , was nonfocal with no motor deficits. 
No significant from change from 1/8 .  
She has coronary artery disease status post acute MI in 2001 , status post two-vessel CABG , she had the left internal mammary to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM-2. 
She has diabetes mellitus. 
She has hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , bladder cancer status post resection. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She denied all vises , such as tobacco , alcohol or drugs. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As in HPI , no fever , chills , rash , medications changes or urinary symptoms. 
ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION: She was an 80-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease here with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure exacerbation most likely left-sided diastolic dysfunction. 
There was no clear etiology , however , dietary or medication issues were not likely given the patient's excellent awareness and involvement in her care. 
The suspicion was that the patient may have had increasing blood hypertension out of control , increasing oxygen demand and creating diastolic function and pulmonary edema. 
The role of her aortic valve was unclear , however , there may have been gradual progression and renal artery stenosis cannot be rule out as an etiology. 
For two days in the middle she was diuresed with IV Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. and she was converted to oral Lasix and actually continued her diuresis , in fact after pacemaker placement , which will be noted below , she may have actually continued to urinate even more so on the last day of her admission. 
Rhythm: In terms of her rhythm , she was found at several points throughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardia consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone; it was thought she would benefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker. 
So , a pacemaker was placed on 6/21/2003 without complications. 
During her stay , patient had low O2 saturations at rest ranging from the high 80s to the low 90s , but often below 88% and on exertion consistently in the mid-80% range , not depending on where the probe was placed. 
A CT of the chest was done on this admission , however , it was consistent with CHF and other things could not be ruled out. 
Visualized organs of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple ill-defined low attenuation foci in the liver but no other abnormality. 
The lung findings were consistent with cardiomegaly and CHF , but could not rule out other diagnostic possibilities including atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity , pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor. 
The liver showed a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it was hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the CT of 7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder was normal with no stones , the biliary tree was normal , as were the right kidney and left kidney , pancreas , although it was poorly visualized. 
If indicated , the PMD should either get a nuclear scan , CT , the radiologist suggested MRI but that is now impossible given the pacemaker , for confirmation and further evaluation. 
Also , it was noted that she had prominent hepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure. 
Her white count also was not elevated. 
Her primary care doctor can consider can titrating her CHF medicines and/or her hypertension medicines.

Her perioperative course was complicated by a brain abscess which was without neurologic residual deficit. 
For the past year prior to presentation , she has had increasing symptoms of right heart failure including lower extremity edema and ascites which did not improve with medical treatment. 
She has no shortness of breath at rest but does have significant dyspnea on exertion with minimal effort. 
She denies fever or chills. 
She is status post cholecystectomy in 1990. 
She , therefore , underwent mitral valve repair on 2 of November but was without significant symptoms for her right heart failure , and was placed on the cardiac transplant list. 
She continued to do quite well with the exception of some dysphagia early in her postoperative course which was found to be possibly secondary to some esophageal ulcerations , but these have subsequently resolved and she is tolerating a regular diet.

The patient was seen in Setlake Caardlin County Medical Center on the day of admission and was noted to have a hematocrit drop from the 37 range to 28.5 along with hypotension and an increasing creatinine rising from 1.2-2.3 in one week's time. 
The patient was noted to have recently significantly increasing lower extremity edema. 
He reports that over a 3-4 day period , he went from having almost no edema to having very large legs , which he describes "tree trunks." 
The patient reports that these were painful at first , but are no longer painful. 
The patient reports no prior history of CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiac problems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attack at 27 years old. 
The patient did not know the details of these cardiac events at 27 years old , and has received minimal followup for this issue. 
He does report that he was intermittently seen by a cardiologist , and had a normal catheterization four years ago. 
The patient did not tell anyone about this at that time , and this pain desisted on its own. 
The pain was described as substernal burning pain , with no left arm pain , no jaw pain , no shortness of breath or diaphoresis , and no nausea or vomiting. 
The patient has had no orthopnea or PND. 
Multiple myeloma ( Kappa ). 2. BPH. 3. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II. 4. Hypertension. 5. Nephrolithiasis. 
2. Lisinopril 20 mg once daily. 
The patient was with his wife , they have no children. 
2. Diabetes mellitus - The patient's sister died of complications of diabetes. 
General: The patient is alert , oriented , in no acute distress , and is not ill appearing. 
No lymphadenopathy. 
Abdomen: Soft , nontender , bowel sounds present and normoactive. 
No hepatosplenomegaly , no frank dullness. 
Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented x3 , has normal affect. 
The patient has also had several recent imaging studies including renal ultrasound on 2/6/05 , which showed multiple bilateral renal cysts but no obstruction. 
An abdominal MRI was obtained on 2/20/05 , which showed small amount of ascites , an enlarged prostate , multiple renal cysts , no other pathologies was noted. 
The patient also had a CT to evaluate his ureters on 10/8/05 , which showed no stones in the kidneys or ureters , but an enlarged prostate. 
This was noted to be present on an old examination , after consultation with an outpatient cardiologist at Lovelin Medical Center .  
The patient's CK was 136 , MB fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. 
Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiac catheterization at Tona Medical Center in 2001 , which showed no obstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary artery disease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. 
An adenosine MIBI obtained in 2002 at Lovelin Medical Center showed possible old inferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 35-40%. 
An echocardiogram obtained during this admission demonstrated the patient's EF at this point to be 25% , rather with global hypokinesis. 
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES: There were no operations or procedures performed during this admission. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to be likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , and increased leg edema and a low blood pressure. 
After consultation with Cardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen as his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and congestive heart failure. 
After diuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had only minimal ectopy. 
Aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having a benefit in cardiac disease of this kind. 
Renal/genitourinary: The patient has a long known history of BPH and is followed closely at Pagham University Of by Dr. Haley Tonsil . 
On admission , the patient's urine did not have any red blood cells , and he had no obvious clots at any point. 
After consultation with Urology , and after the patient had been diuresing well with Lasix , the patient's Foley catheter was removed and after this point he had no problem with urinating. 
First of all , the patient is known to have been losing blood in the form of clots from his bladder. 
The patient's hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained in the 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. 
He was , however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse him should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiac history. 
During this admission , multiple myeloma was not an active issue. 
See Brook Mepa Community Hospital notes for more information. 
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes , he takes Lantus and Novolog at home. 
He did not complain of any pain during admission. 
These apparently were not effective at first. 
At one point , he would not take his medications. 
At one point when he became agitated , he was given Haldol intravenously , in addition to Ativan , after being given these medications , the patient slept very well through the night. 
When he awoke the next morning , his mood was much improved , and he apologized for his behavior , reporting he did not know what happened. 
Because of the change in mental status , several studies were obtained to investigate this , a head CT showed no acute disease , only some bony changes likely chronic due to multiple myeloma. 
In addition , the patient's electrolytes were checked which were normal , the patient's fingerstick blood glucose was checked which was normal. 
COMPLICATIONS: There were no complications during this admission. 
On discharge , the patient was urinating well and had no urinary symptoms. 
Lisinopril 2.5 mg once daily.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM. 2 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. 3 ) HYPERTENSION. 4 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year-old woman with a history of myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation , hypertension and congestive heart failure who presents with shortness of breath. 
Thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severe hypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ). 
She was started on Procainamide and subsequently as an outpatient on PTU without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. 
She ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeat catheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. 
Also , she had an increase in orthopnea from one to two pillows , diaphoresis and worsening of her baseline right shoulder pain with no edema. 
She had a cough productive of scant white sputum for three days prior to admission , no fever or chills. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction in October of 1998 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , hyperthyroidism , bilateral retinal detachment , status post left cataract surgery , status post appendectomy , status post cholecystectomy. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
She has no alcohol use. 
There was a question of a right carotid bruit. 
There was no thyromegaly. 
Lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing. 
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an S4 , intermittent S3 , no murmurs. 
Abdomen revealed normal active bowel sounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatile liver. 
Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
There was no calf tenderness. 
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonary vascular redistribution , Kerley B lines , but no infiltrate. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment was that the patient presented in acute congestive heart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the setting of hypertension. 
Other contributing factors possibly playing a role in the patient's heart failure could have included medication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. 
Another possibility entertained was that the patient could have had transient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however all of her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning this possibility. 
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs , Troponin and EKG. 2 ) Hyperthyroidism: The patient's TSA was measured to be at less than assay on May , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolled hyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiac dysfunction. 
The patient is to receive follow-up in the Thyroid Clinic for definitive therapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in her left lobe. 3 ) Elevated white blood cell count on admission , but with a normal differential: The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospital course. 
Urinalysis was negative for infection and repeat chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Neurological: The patient has had no neurological events during his hospitalization. 
He continues on Paxil 40 mg p.o. q. day for depression , and he has no pain. 
His prior episode had been in 1977 at which time he was found to have modest triple vessel coronary disease. 
Preoperatively , he was found to have severe triple vessel coronary artery disease. 
The patient was taken for coronary artery bypass grafting times three as described above on 10/6/03 .  
This was performed by Dr. Colasamte without complications. 
He currently has no respiratory issues. 
His most recent chest x-ray was a portable chest x-ray on 5/25/03 , which showed subsegmental atelectasis and a minimal right pleural effusion , but no evidence of congestive heart failure or other disease processes. 
Gastrointestinal: A preoperative work-up before his coronary artery bypass graft surgery showed that the patient was guaiac positive and EGD on 12/10/03 by Dr. Cujas showed no lesions as a likely cause of his GI bleeding , but did reveal some gastritis. 
At first it was thought that his symptoms were due to Ogilivie's syndrome or pseudo-obstruction , however , because of his distention it was not felt safe to perform a barium enema. 
He had absolutely no pain or tenderness. 
The General Surgery Service was consulted and an NG tube was placed , and he was given enemas p.r. He did well with no complaints of pain or tenderness , however , a KUB on 9/8/03 showed that his cecum was distended 12 centimeters and the white count was over 20. CT scan showed a cecum to be 14 centimeters and there was a suggestion of narrowing of the sigmoid colon. 
A right colectomy , sigmoid colectomy , cholecystectomy , transverse mucous fistula , and sigmoid mucous fistula were performed.

ALLERGIES: The patient has questionable penicillin allergies with unknown reaction. 
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM: In general , the patient is an obese Hispanic male who is sedated and intubated. 
His skin showed his lower extremities with changes of chronic venostasis. 
His feet had onychomycosis bilaterally with no clearcut abrasions or cuts. 
His abdomen was obese. 
He had a large panus , no appreciable organomegaly , tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds. 
There were no focal anomalies. 
Given the history and timing of the arrest , the patient likely was hypercarbic secondary to COPD exacerbation , as hypercarbic arrest occurred several days in house where opiates were not administered. 
Also , the patient has significant cardiac history of CHF and CAD , which may have contributed. 
The patient has not had , at the time of admission , white count or a significant fever and his cultures two days prior to discharge have been negative. 
Presumably , the aggressive diuresis that was conducted did not affect the patient's renal function adversely. 
The patient has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Clear sounding lungs with breath sounds that can be heard more extensively than before from the anterior side , resolving chronic venostasis and with those exceptions the patient's exam remain similar to his admission exam.

Type II diabetes mellitus. 
Status post skin graft on right heel for diabetic ulcers in 1997. 
Diabetic retinopathy. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Rodger Eagleman is a 66 year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease who presents to us with right leg swelling , pain and tenderness times 2-3 days. 
The patient was last discharged from Pagham University Of for congestive heart failure exacerbation and chronic abdominal distention on November , 2000. 
She was in her usual state of poor health until three days prior to admission when she noted an increase in lower extremity edema bilaterally. 
Two days prior to admission she noted fever , increased abdominal distention and abdominal pain. 
She noted rash in the right lower extremity the day prior to presentation which had rapidly progressed over one day , extending from heel to knee. 
She had not been walking for four days due to swelling in bilateral legs. 
She denies chest pain , dyspnea , constipation , diarrhea , orthopnea , PND , nocturia , melena. 
She does not keep track of her own weight. 
Her last bowel movement was one day prior to admission which was normal brown , slightly loose. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for 1. coronary artery disease. 
She had a stress test in 1994 which showed anterior ischemia with no fixed defects. 
She had an echo in July , 1997 which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with an EF of 55% with minor inferior hypokinesis. 
3. Type II diabetes mellitus. 
Complications include peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.9 and diabetic gastroparesis. 
12. Status post cholecystectomy. 
MEDICATION: On admission include Insulin NPH pork 45 units q a.m. , 8 units q p.m. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Vaseretic 10/25 mg q.d. , Dulcolax 10 mg q.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Senokot 2 mg b.i.d. , Diazepam 5 mg b.i.d. , Lipitor 10 mg q.d. , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , Lasix 60 mg q.d. , lactulose 30 mg b.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d. , Naprosyn p.r.n. 
She does not have a history of smoking or drinking. 
General examination: This is an obese woman lying at a 30 degree angle on the bed , pleasant and not in acute distress. 
Lungs have rales up one-third of the lungs bilaterally , no wheezes or rhonchi. 
Jugular venous pulsation at 11 cm. 
Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , mildly distended , no mass and normal bowel sounds. 
She also has a 5 cm x 5 cm skin graft over the right heel with some skin breakdown around the graft site , slightly weepy , no pus. 
The patient does not have any sensation in bilateral legs. 
Her liver function tests were within normal range. 
Her CK first set was 120 with an MB of 2.6 and troponin of 1.39 , coags normal D-dimer of greater than 1 , 010. 
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial prominence , could be consistent with pulmonary edema , no focal opacities. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1 , CELLULITIS: On admission , the patient was started on cefazolin and Flagyl for broad coverage of cellulitis given she has a history of diabetes mellitus. 
They concluded that the skin graft is intact and the source of the cellulitis was not in the heel. 
On hospital day #3 , Flagyl was discontinued because the patient could not tolerate oral sores and the GI upset. 
The patient also had LENIs which were negative for DVT as well as a right foot film which showed no signs of osteomyelitis. 
Unfortunately , the cellulitis does not look significantly improved. 
We postulate that this is due to a combination of noncompliance with strict elevation , peripheral edema from congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease and diabetes. 
Infectious Disease recommends an MRI to rule out osteo and deeper infection since the cellulitis is very slowly improving. 
In addition , we started her on her outpatient blood pressure medications to control her hypertension. 
The urinalysis showed numerous red blood cells and no eosinophils. 
Of note , her urine culture grew out lactobacillus which was not treated. 
At this time , she underwent a CT with contrast to delineate a possible liver mass. 
PROBLEM #3 , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST NON Q-WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The patient was admitted on a rule out protocol. 
The patient was asymptomatic with no chest pains and no electrocardiogram changes. 
Cardiology was consulted and it was felt that the patient had a small non Q-wave myocardial infarction with a troponin leak. 
A repeat echo on this admission showed preserved EF at 55% with no observable wall motion abnormalities. 
Her enalapril and outpatient dose of Atenolol were held. 
She was started back on Metoprolol after the non Q-wave myocardial infarction. 
We attempted to add back enalapril at this time to preserve her kidney function given her diabetes. 
A KUB was obtained on admission which showed air in the colon but no obstruction. 
It was thought that her chronic distention is from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility. 
Because the patient continued to spike a low grade temperature and she had some abnormal liver function tests , we pursued a renal ultrasound to rule out her renal abscess which was negative , as well as a right upper quadrant ultrasound. 
The right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a possible liver mass for which we ordered a followup CT of the abdomen. 
The CT of the abdomen showed normal variant of the shape of the liver , caused by a bowel loop that was anterior to the liver. 
However , since the patient was stable with no further decrease in the hematocrit , it was decided that the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia in terms of colonoscopy. 
PROBLEM #7 , VASCULAR: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease on admission. 
ABIs were obtained of the right leg which showed 0.5 to 0.6 on the right lower extremity and normal on the left lower extremity which has been previously bypassed. 
The conclusion was that the patient had right femoral popliteal disease with normal resting pressures on the left. 
However , as the patient is not very mobile , she does not complain of any claudication symptoms. 
It was decided that no surgery is indicated for her at this time. 
PROBLEM #8 , CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has congestive heart failure from diastolic dysfunction. 
She continued to diurese on her own without any pharmacologic interventions , as her creatinine improved.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease likely due to her diabetes mellitus. 
Dr. Ahlborn that her acute renal failure may be due to chronic kidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due to interstitial nephritis in the setting of a drug allergy. 
After consideration of possibilities causing her acute renal failure , it was thought that her acute renal failure was most likely due to cholesterol emboli syndrome given her eosinophilia , stepwise progression of renal impairment and her chronic course. 
In addition , the patient has known renal artery stenosis that may have contributed to her acute renal failure and she did have a possible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps a component of her renal failure was also due to acute interstitial nephritis. 
Congestive heart failure: The patient had evidence for congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension during this hospitalization. 
The patient showed no improvement on this medication and it was discontinued after a short trial. 
The patient's diuresis was discontinued prior to discharge as the patient did have acute worsening of her renal function , which may have been related to over aggressive diuresis. 
The patient was instead started on spironolactone for management of her congestive heart failure. 
Ischemia: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease. 
She was maintained on aspirin , statin and a beta-blocker during the admission. 
The patient should not receive any heparin flushes. 
At this time , the results of the inhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as an outpatient. 
The patient completed a course of ceftazidime and remained afebrile off antibiotics with no signs of active infection. 
She did not show clinical signs of pneumonia. 
Her oxygen requirement is thought to be due to atelectasis , deconditioning , as well as her known congestive heart failure and likely pulmonary hypertension. 
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and was followed by the Diabetes Nursing Service during her stay. 
She did not have any evidence of mediastinal mass and no abnormalities of the recurrent laryngeal nerve were seen. 
as needed for pain , aspirin 81 mg p.o. once a day , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. once a day , amitriptyline 10 mg p.o. twice a day , Plavix 75 mg p.o. once a day , Aranesp 40 mcg subcutaneous q. week , Benadryl 25 mg p.o. every six hours as needed for itching , Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day , flecainide 75 mg p.o. q.12h.

She had no loss of consciousness , no head trauma. 
The following morning she was still with consider lower back and buttock pain radiating to her right leg. 
She took her normal oxycodone and Vicodin doses without relief , and EMS brought the patient to the hospital. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , myocardial infarction non-Q-wave September , 2001 , a MICU admission during that time , in September , 2001 , for urosepsis , diabetic ketoacidosis and this non-Q-wave MI. Also , sciatica with previous history of a herniated disc L5-S1 , question obstructive sleep apnea with mild pulmonary hypertension by previous echo. 
An September , 2001 , echo showed left ventricular ejection fraction 50% , hypokinesis in the inferior septum , mildly enlarged RV , pulmonary artery pressures of 39 plus RA , suggestive of mild pulmonary hypertension and mild MR and TR. LABORATORY DATA: On admission , labs were significant for a glucose of 121 , creatinine 1.4 , baseline was one , potassium of 5.2 , CK of 355 , a UA with plus two leukocyte esterase , 85 whites , plus two bacteria. 
She was in no distress. 
She was obese. 
She had no head trauma. 
Her abdomen was markedly obese , positive bowel sounds , nontender. 
She had no spinal tenderness , no pelvic tenderness. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted and was scheduled to undergo an MRI for evaluation of acutely herniated disc at an outside facility at York , secondary to not being able to fit within the coils at our own facility. 
She was extubated without complications. 
Her renal function was presumed to be secondary high-dose NSAIDs , and her intubation was deemed to be secondary to a primary respiratory acidosis from opioid intoxication exacerbated by renal failure. 
Data from this admission do not support a diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome , because there was no daytime hypercapnia by both ABGs and Chem-7 panel. 
Patient with preserved EF , no valve disease. 
Patient will need sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.

RECORD #243
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old woman with longstanding hypertension , coronary artery disease ( status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 ) , hypercholesterolemia , positive tobacco use , positive family history for coronary artery disease , adult onset diabetes mellitus , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , peptic ulcer disease ( with history of gastrointestinal bleed ) , and stable angina who presented with rest angina in a crescendo pattern not relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. 
The patient had no chest pain history until 1992 when she presented with chest pain and had a markedly positive exercise tolerance test. 
Cardiac catheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80% mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but was complicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the left anterior descending. 
The patient did well until 2/11 ( with rare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina which began approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graft and were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when she developed worsening right lower extremity claudication requiring angioplasty. 
The patient did not have sublingual nitroglycerin with her at the time. 
Upon returning home , the patient obtained relief with one sublingual nitroglycerin ( patient had described the pain at 9/10 with left chest to axilla pain and no other radiation ). 
The patient awoke in the morning and shortly thereafter , had chest pain which was not relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Longstanding hypertension. 
The patient had an upper GI series/colonoscopy which were negative per the patient. 
The patient had an ongoing stable pattern of gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease that was minimized by avoiding fatty foods. 
3 ) Adult onset diabetes mellitus. 
4 ) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no hospitalizations or intubations and currently not on any therapy. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This revealed an obese middle-aged woman who was feisty but in no acute distress. 
NECK: No lymphadenopathy , thyromegaly without nodular feeling , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugular venous pressure approximately 7 cm. 
CARDIAC: Point of maximal intensity was not appreciated , regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 was split , and no S3 , S4 , or murmurs. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended , obese with no hepatosplenomegaly , and no femoral artery bruits with 1+ palpable pulses bilaterally. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focal except for 4/5 right lower extremity proximal muscle strength , 1+ deep tendon reflexes throughout , and toes downgoing bilaterally. 
Chest x-ray showed no active disease. 
EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm of 90 , axis 70 degrees , normal intervals , no ST or T wave changes , no left ventricular hypertrophy , and no change as compared with 4/17 .  
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was first ruled out for a myocardial infarction and the patient did , in fact , rule out.

RECORD #244
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Bown is a pleasant 52 year old obese black female with history of diabetes , chronic lower extremity venous stasis , history of cellulitis who presented with left lower extremity pain , edema , and erythema. 
The patient has had a long history of diabetes since 1984 for which she has been treated with diet and glyburide with poorly controlled blood sugars until Metformin was added in October of 1996. 
In the past five years the patient has also become morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds. 
In October of 1996 she was treated for diabetic stasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV antibiotics. 
Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was attributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was thought to be compromising venous return. 
Her stool was watery brown without any blood or mucus. 
She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatures were not measured. 
On the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea had resolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. 
She has had no chest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs of infection except her left leg. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Bilateral lower extremity edema with chronic venous stasis changes. 
History of hypertension. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies alcohol , cigarettes , or drug use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese , pleasant , African American woman in no apparent distress. 
Her HEENT exam was nonicteric with moist oropharynx and no lesions. 
The neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy. 
There were no carotid bruits. 
Her abdominal exam was obese , non-positive for bowel sounds. 
There was mild tenderness over the periumbilical region with some fullness/ suggestion of a mass. 
There was no rebound or guarding , no right upper quadrant tenderness , no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly ( exam limited by obesity ). 
The differential on the white blood cell count was 78 polys , 38 bands , 6 lymphs , 3 monocytes , and no eos. 
Chest x-ray on admission revealed low lung volumes with possible left total effusion that was blurring left lower lobe air space disease. 
Abdominal ultrasound performed on admission revealed no hydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system. 
Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. 
Blood cultures and wound cultures sent did not reveal any organisms. 
Because of the patient's very high white blood cell count , the ID consult team was concerned for the possibility of toxic shock syndrome; therefore , Clindamycin IV was also added to her regimen of antibiotics. 
Because the patient's left leg did not appear to be getting better on antibiotics , a Surgical consult was obtained to rule out a deeper seated infection in the patient's thigh. 
A CT of both of her legs were obtained instead which revealed no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it did incidentally detect a large effusion in the patient's left knee. 
Studies on the left knee effusion revealed 13 , 000 white blood cells with negative gram stain and negative crystal exam times 3. Cultures of the left knee fluid did not grow any organisms. 
For this reason an Orthopedic consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the OR for possible debridement. 
There was no connection between the pus collection and the left knee effusion. 
The acute renal failure was initially thought to be secondary to dehydration; the patient was given IV hydration with no improvement in her creatinine. 
It was the impression of the Renal Service that the patient's acute renal failure was likely multifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy , low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , and medications which included NSAIDs as well as ACE inhibitor. 
Upper extremity non-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for any clots. 
An echocardiogram was also obtained showing no evidence of right heart dysfunction. 
However , given that the patient had poor access and had an anemia , it was decided that the patient would not be heparinized. 
Her right upper extremity swelling was observed closely and with elevation of the right arm over the next few days gradually resolved without any complications. 
On the day prior to discharge a repeat right upper extremity ultrasound was obtained which revealed no evidence of blood clots in her right arm. 
Abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities in the patient's liver or biliary system to account for the mild transaminitis found on admission.

RECORD #245
The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus , end-stage renal disease with subsequent renal transplant 11 years ago donated by his sister for which he takes cyclosporine and azathioprine. 
He tried to increase his insulin , but found he did not have an adequate response. 
The patient became more weak and was brought to the Osri Medical Center Emergency Department where he was found to have moderate diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration. 
The patient's workup also suggested acute myocardial infarction and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit. 
Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mild left atrial enlargement and intact interatrial septum , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrium with history of thrombus , inferobasilar and inferoseptal akinesis consistent with old inferoposterior myocardial infarction , mild tricuspid regurgitation , trileaflet aortic valve , which is quite mobile with no evidence for significant aortic insufficiency , normal pulmonic valve and aortic atherosclerosis. 
He underwent a coronary cardiac catheterization and was found to have the following , left main coronary artery with an ostial 100% stenosis. 
Formal report is not available at this time. 
The patient was then transferred to Pagham University Of for urgent coronary artery bypass grafting. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction , history of class II heart failure , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , diabetic vasculopathy , renal failure and nephropathy. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
Neurologic , alert and oriented with no focal deficits. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Baldon was brought to the operating room on 2/1/06 where he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with a sequential graft from the saphenous vein graft from aorta to the ramus and then the second obtuse marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery. 
The patient's chest tubes were removed and post-pull chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.

RECORD #246
The patient is a 67-year-old female with history of coronary artery disease who was first evaluated back in 2002 when she had a stent placed at CEMH for symptomatic coronary artery disease. 
Repeat angiography was performed revealing suboptimal deployment of the initial stent , which was subsequently outsized to a diameter of 3.5 mm and additional stenting was performed distal to the original stent with good anterograde flow noted postprocedure. 
Hospital course was notable for distributive and cardiogenic shock as well as aspiration pneumonia and HSV , treated with acyclovir. 
The patient was subsequently transferred to Totin Hospital And Clinic for further management of her advanced heart failure. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant in addition to above for hypertension , type 2 diabetes on insulin , obesity , COPD , hyperlipidemia , GERD , hypothyroidism , depression , status post appendectomy and status post cholecystectomy. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , hemoptysis , bright red blood per rectum , hematochezia , or melena , no chest pain or palpitations. 
No changes in mental status or loss of consciousness , no dysuria , no exposures. 
INR 1. EKG , sinus rhythm at 90 , normal axis intervals with old anterior septal MI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for afebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 18-20 , satting 98% on 3 liters. 
The patient was in no acute distress , pleasant , resting comfortably. 
JVP 10 cm with 2+ carotids without bruits. 
No thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy. 
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2. Notable S3 , no MR appreciated. 
Abdomen was obese , distended , soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Right groin minimally tender without bruit. 
Neurologic exam is nonfocal. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary , this is a 67-year-old female with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , coronary artery disease status post LAD stent complicated by a subacute thrombosis with marked left ventricular dysfunction with a reportedly revascularized right coronary territory and severe MR on repeat echo. 
The patient was admitted to medically optimized heart failure regimen to further clarify component of mitral regurgitation. 
Adenosine MIBI was completed , which was notable for recovery 1 mm ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF , which resolved. 
There is no further evidence of ischemia. 
EF was notable to be severely depressed; however , moderate MR on outside hospital echo was not reproducible here. 
Cardiovascular surgery was initially consulted to further evaluate for benefit of mitral valve replacement surgery; however , this will likely not be of benefit given mild MR on repeat echo. 
In addition a contrast echo was performed to further evaluate for evidence of clot given the severe right ventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however , there was no evidence of clot on echo. 
The EP service evaluated for possible placement of AICD versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patient is not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible on EP study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient with repeat echo in 2 months and a further EP study to readdress. 
Respiratory: The patient has history of COPD with no evidence of acute exacerbation. 
PFTs and VO2 study may be considered as an outpatient. 
LFTs were elevated on admission consistent with right heart failure versus statin.

Endocrine: The patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes and was maintained on insulin as an inpatient with sliding scale coverage. 
TSH within normal limits. 
The patient was treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria secondary to possible permanent pacemaker placement. 
Psychiatric: The patient has a history of depression. 
No evidence of further infection. 
The patient had pretibial erythema , which derm was consulted for , which they felt was consistent with venous stasis.

RECORD #248
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sobe is a 60 year old woman with adult onset diabetes , hypertension , and severe peripheral vascular disease status post cerebrovascular accident in 1986 , who was recently admitted to I Warho Hospital between 7/8/23 with what was presumed to be an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and new onset congestive heart failure. 
An echocardiogram performed during that admission showed normal left and right ventricular function and size. 
Since her discharge , Ms. Sobe has become progressively weak and has noted gradually increasing shortness of breath on exertion. 
She denies fevers and chills , reports a dry cough but no nausea or vomiting. 
The cough was nonproductive. 
She has had poor oral intake , however , no change in her bowel habits and no symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection. 
She denies any episodes of chest pain , however , notes that she requires three pillows to sleep on , new onset orthopnea and new onset pedal edema. 
She presented to the I Warho Hospital to the emergency department after having increased shortness of breath the night preceding the 6 of July and was noted on arrival to the emergency room to have a blood pressure of 200/100 with an oxygen saturation on 100% face mask of 85%. 
Portable chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure and she has been on Lasix , Morphine Sulfate , in addition to nebulizer treatment. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cerebrovascular accident in 1986 , diabetes mellitus since 1985 , she has been insulin dependent; hypertension; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a long history of smoking. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
She has a sixty pack year history of smoking but no longer smokes and denies any alcohol use. 
HEENT exam was notable for normocephalic , atraumatic head. 
Jugular venous pressure was 10 cm and the carotids were without bruits. 
Neck was without adenopathy. 
Cardiac exam showed that she was tachycardic but with a regular rhythm and S1 and S2 were heard clearly with an S4 , there were no murmurs or rubs noted. 
Abdomen; notable for positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly and no other masses felt. 
Extremities; 2+ pitting edema bilaterally with 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally without femoral bruits. 
Rectal exam showed no masses and was guaiac negative. 
LFT's were within normal limits. 
The differential on her white count demonstrated 82 polys , 12 lymphocytes , 5 monocytes , 1 eosinophil. 
Her first CK was 33 with no MB fraction and an arterial blood gas /showed pH of 7.41 , 31 , 77 , 23 , and 96%. 
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions and increased pulmonary vascular redistribution. 
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 120 with normal intervals and axis , with some flattening in the STT waves in the lateral lead. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was initially admitted to the floor where she received another dose of IV Lasix and 30 mg po Nifedipine. 
Twenty minutes later , patient was noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70. 
She was given a small IV bolus of 100 cc normal saline with no response to her systolic blood pressure. 
She was noted to be nauseated and vomited x1 with midscapular back pain but no chest pain. 
She was markedly diaphoretic , but did not complain of palpitations. 
She was started on Dopamine 20 micrograms per kilograms with initially no response. 
She was started on a beta blocker and her rule out protocol for myocardial infarction showed flat CK's , CK's numbering 33 , 58 , and 147 , with no MB fractions and no further EKG changes , and no further episodes of nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. 
She did not complain of chest pain , shortness of breath , or diaphoresis. 
Patient was given one tablet of sublingual Nitroglycerin with no change in her heart rate and her blood pressure went to 180/60 and she complained of a headache. 
She was given 5 mg IV push Lopressor q 5 minutes x3 with response of her heart rate to 90. EKG post intervention was without change and she was maintained on 3 liters oxygen via nasal cannula , without change in her O2 saturation. 
At that time , the patient was started on Heparin 5 , 000 units IV bolus and maintained at 1200 units per hour , and a rule out protocol was again started. 
Her CK's were flat and there were no further EKG changes. 
The decision to proceed with cardiac catheterization was presented to the patient and on the 4th hospital day , the patient initially refused cardiac catheterization. 
However , after further consideration , she agreed to cardiac catheterization on the 7th hospital day , 6/4/93 .  
Because of her history of acute renal failure with creatinine rising from baseline of 1 to 1.7 on previous admission with the initiation of Captopril , she had concurrently an abdominal aortogram to rule out renal artery stenosis. 
Her right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 with a diffusely diseased left coronary system , right coronary with serial stenoses of 50% proximal and 30% distal , and anterior apical hypokinesis with preserved LV systolic function. 
An echocardiogram revealed anteroseptal akinesis at the apex without any mention of thrombus , moderately dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction estimated at 30%. 
Her catheterization results suggested that she would be best managed medically and her hospital course then was notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix and one time dose of Zaroxolyn , and rate control initially with Diltiazem with moderate success and then by the 7th hospital day the addition of Lopressor. 
By the time of her discharge , her O2 saturation was 95% on room air and she was able to ambulate without assistance or complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath. 
ID: On admission , patient's white blood cell count was noted to be 16 and it was persistently high throughout the first four or five days of her hospital course. 
She remained afebrile until the 6th hospital day , when she was noted to have one temperature of 101. 
Blood culture , urine culture , sputum , and chest x-ray did not reveal any evidence of infection and patient's white count was noted to fall to 9.8. 
No IV antibiotics were given. 
DIABETES; Patient was maintained on her normal dose of insulin and except for the day when she went to catheterization , and covered with CZI sliding scale. 
Her blood sugars initially ran in the 200 to 300 range but by the end of admission she was more well controlled between 100 and 200 , and did not require addition of CZI sliding scale. 
Of note , patient had described previous incidences of feeling diaphoretic and hungry in which she would eat presumably secondary to hypoglycemia. 
After starting her beta blocker , she continued to have these sensations of hypoglycemia and if so , it was though to be safe to continue with the beta blocker treatment. 
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE; Patient has a history of femoral stenosis and had been suggested that she have a femoral angioplasty several years previously. 
Patient refused that procedure at the time and has had no further complications. 
During this admission a renal arteriogram was performed , which showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis with a mild non-flow in the stenosis in the right renal artery. 
DISPOSITION: There were no complications. 
Her congestive heart failure was largely resolved , and she was discharged to home with follow-up to be with Dr. Carmelita Toni in KTDUOO Clinic.

9 ) DEPRESSION. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year-old morbidly obese black female with a history of restrictive lung disease , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent lower extremity deep venous thromboses requiring multiple hospitalizations who was initially evaluated on March , 1996 for right knee pain. 
Evaluation revealed a small right knee effusion consistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity. 
She has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. 
Apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start the patient on the C-PAP at home , but the patient had been resistant and she has a long history of medical non-compliance. 
The patient has been on chronic Coumadin , however there is a question of whether or not , she has been taking it regularly. 
There has also been a question in the past of possible diastolic dysfunction. 
In September of 1994 , she had an echocardiogram which showed some left ventricular hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of approximately 55% , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspid regurgitation. 
Other past medical history includes a history of depression. 
The patient has chronic hypoxemia , obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic lower extremity deep venous thromboses and obstructive lung disease. 
No alcohol , no intravenous drugs. 
She was intubated on March , 1996 and quickly extubated on April , 1996 without complications. 
Given the patient's history of restrictive lung disease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up to search for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs. parenchymal disease. 
She had an echocardiogram on August , 1996 , which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% , mild left ventricular hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities , a top normal sized right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and a suggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm of Mercury plus the estimated right atrial pressure. 
This echocardiogram was performed with a bubble study and there was no obvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or saline infusion. 
In order to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lung disease , the patient underwent a PA gram on September , 1996 to rule out the possibility of chronic pulmonary emboli. 
This study revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. 
The overall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was most likely secondary to obesity. 
The patient did not complain of right pain subsequent to her discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
However , on the date of discharge , the patient was complaining of a burning sensation in her throat after drinking orange juice which tended to come and go , but did not radiate and she was switched from Axid to Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day on March , 1996. 
She has menopausal since her 40s and has had not had any recent gynecological following. 
9 ) Neurological: The patient did not demonstrate any evidence of depression and was stable on Zoloft. 10 ) General Care: The patient underwent Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy throughout the hospitalization. 
It was thought that she would benefit greatly from inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation or possibly weight loss reduction , however the patient repeatedly declined pulmonary rehabilitation and weight loss reduction and felt that she would be able to manage herself at home. 
The patient was to proceed with bi-PAP , however due to the need for medical assistance , she may not receive it for another two weeks and is to continue with her home oxygen.

Discharge Date: 7/20/1995 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: HYPERLIPIDEMIA HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Helmstetter is a 54 year old professor at Tempe Lare , status post coronary artery bypass graft ( 5 vessel bypass ) 8 years ago who presents with recurrent substernal chest pain times one day. 
The patient was under no extraordinary circumstances ( e.g. emotional stress , exertional stress ) at the time he developed chest pain. 
Since the time of his five vessel CABG in 1987 , the patient had experienced no intercurrent angina. 
The patient's coronary risk factors include a positive family history and a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. 
However the patient does not have hypertension , diabetes and he is not a tobacco smoker. 
The patient presented to CHH urgent care where his pain was not relieved with four sublingual nitroglycerin. 
The patient has no known drug allergies. 
HABITS: The patient denies tobacco use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , Mr. Helmstetter is a pleasant middle-aged man , mildly anxious but in no acute distress. 
Neck: no jugular venous distention ( JVP less than 6 cm ) , carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits or delayed upstroke. 
There were no rubs , murmurs or gallops appreciated. 
The point of maximum impulse was not displaced. 
The patient's spine was not tender and there was no evidence of costovertebral angle tenderness. 
Extremities demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
Urine had a specific gravity of 1.021 , pH 5 , negative dipstick evaluation. 
Chest x-ray demonstrated clear lung parenchyma and no bony abnormalities. 
The patient exercised 9 minutes and was able to complete the study without dyspnea on exertion or chest pain. 
The exercise tolerance test was interpreted as strongly positive for ischemic coronary artery disease. 
There was no evidence of ischemic reperfusion defects. 
The patient was offered the opportunity for coronary catheterization to evaluate his anatomy , but he declined at the present time. 
The patient did not experience this same anterior thigh pain while riding a bicycle or swimming. 
As an inpatient , Mr. Helmstetter underwent a non-invasive vascular study of the femoral and popliteal arteries. 
These demonstrated no significant arterial occlusions as assessed by pressure manometry. 
The possibility of myositis or neuromuscular compromise was entertained and these are to be followed up as an outpatient. 
A chest x-ray on 5/7/95 demonstrated evidence of early congestive heart failure. 
By the time of discharge , there was no evidence of continued heart failure and the patient's Lasix was discontinued. 
The patient was instructed to call CHH Urgent Care if his chest pain recurs and does not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.

RECORD #251
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54-year-old woman with history of asthma/COPD , morbid obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , but does not tolerate BiPAP who presented to the emergency room with worsening somnolence. 
At baseline , she is alert and oriented and walks intermittently with walker , although , at most time she is bedbound because of her obesity and an injured knee at the end of October .  
Over the previous week apparently , the patient had difficulty with her home oxygen machine and she felt like she "was not getting any air". 
They had come in and said that he should figure out how to fix it according to him , as she had not been getting oxygen for the week prior to admission. 
She had not had any increase in cough or sputum production. 
She also had not any change in her baseline lower extremity swelling/deformity and no increased erythema or pain in her lower extremities. 
She has not had any recent long trips , although she had been somewhat bed bound after this knee injury. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , severe left ventricular hypertrophy , asthma/COPD without known pulmonary function testing in the past , morbid obesity weighing approximately 460 pounds , obstructive sleep apnea - she could not tolerate CPAP in the past , osteoarthritis , and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as a distant history of pulmonary embolus. 
After having a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 4/3 , she was anticoagulated for several months , but not since then. 
She opened her eyes to sternal rub but not to voice. 
Abdomen is obese. 
Extremities were cool with chronic venostasis changes perhaps lymphedema changes bilaterally. 
Urinalysis was significant for 3+ protein , 2+ blood , positive leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , and bacteria as well as trichomonas. 
Her urine and serum tox screens did not reveal any toxins. 
The ET tube was 3.5 cm from the corner , otherwise , extraordinarily limited , but no gross consolidation or effusions were noted. 
A pulmonary embolus CT scan or V/Q scan were considered to rule out a pulmonary embolus; however , the patient's abdominal girth prevented either of these studies from being done. 
Lower extremity noninvasive studies were performed , which did not show any clot although this was also limited by her chronic lower extremity changes. 
ASSESSMENT AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: This is a 54-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen as well as obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension , and left ventricular hypertrophy and obesity with mental status changes and respiratory changes consistent with an exacerbation of recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease and hypoxemia. 
As we were preparing to intubate the trachea , the patient became more alert and requested to speak to her son beforehand and saying she did not want to have the tube down her throat. 
Her son came in and she continued making more sense and asking us not to intubate her trachea. 
She was treated for her pulmonary disease initially with corticosteroids , which were discontinued given that we did not feel that she had large a inflammatory component to this , Levofloxacin 500 mg a day , albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and she was started on an inhaled corticosteroid. 
2. Vascular: The possibility of a pulmonary embolus was considered especially given her history of pulmonary embolus in the past. 
There is discussion of putting her on chronic anticoagulation for the possibility of pulmonary embolus; however , we felt she had a low to moderate probability of pulmonary embolus and that the risks of long-term anticoagulation outweigh the benefits given that she probably did not have a pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis. 
The decision was also centered around the fact that her previous pulmonary embolus was in the setting of pelvic surgery and likely did not reflex any increased likelihood of thrombosis. 
3. Cardiac: The patient has a history of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. 
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
It may be considered that she will be good candidate for metformin given her weight and likely poor control of her diabetes. 
The patient should be counseled and encouraged to use her BiPAP or CPAP machine at home all the time at night given her likely severe obstructive sleep apnea and known vascular effects of that.

RECORD #252
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old woman with coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy admitted with clinical shortness of breath. 
The patient has a long history of coronary artery disease with most recent echocardiogram in 8/06 showing dilated left ventricle , ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , inferior posterior thinning and akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal septum to apex. 
The grafts were without significant disease. 
She denies dietary indiscretion or medical noncompliance and reports that her peripheral edema is stable. 
She denies dysuria or frequency and also believes that her weight has increased although notes on chart indicate that her baseline is 220 to 228 pounds. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiac risk factors were age and hypertension. 
Diabetes mellitus , nonproliferative anemia , one non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 1981 , coronary artery bypass grafting in 1995 at Pagham University Of with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending graft , saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery graft , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal graft. 
Several admissions for congestive heart failure including one in 1996 which included an echocardiogram with ejection fraction of 40%. 
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , status post appendectomy , status post right mastoidectomy ( secondary to recurrent otitis ). 
Head CT showed no sign of infarct. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Retired housewife , married , rare alcohol use , no tobacco use. 
General: Large woman lying in bed in no acute distress. 
HEENT: Jugulovenous pressure greater than 12 cm , oropharynx clear , no thyromegaly. 
Hematocrit of 35.5 with MCV of 80. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with presumptive diagnosis of recent tracheal bronchitis complicated by overlying congestive heart failure. 
Her cough was essentially nonproductive and thus sputum was not sent. 
An attempt to increase her beta blocker appeared to exacerbate this bradycardia and thus she was discharged on the same dose that she was admitted with , i.e. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
Notably , even when these medications were held , her pulse was often in the high 40s or low 50s without symptoms and remained less than 60 even while walking some of the time. 
The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine were thought secondary to her congestive heart failure and in fact , her creatinine decreased with diuresis.

Coronary risk factors include a positive family history , no smoking , diabetes mellitus , hypertension or elevated cholesterol. 
There was no shortness of breath , palpitations , light-headedness , nausea or vomiting. 
It was not relieved by any factors. 
She denied any fevers , chills , cough , shortness of breath , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain or dysuria. 
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination she is a well-developed , well-nourished female appearing her stated age and in no apparent distress. 
Oropharynx revealed no erythema , edema or exudate. 
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. 
There were no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Abdomen is soft and non-tender with positive bowel sounds. 
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or masses noted. 
Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
Neurological examination was non-focal. 
The elevated CK with the very low MB was felt not to represent a myocardial infarction but to represent a CK leak from presumed pulmonary infarction. 
The team felt that , given the patient's clinical history and the implications of chronic Coumadin therapy , that a pulmonary embolus should be definitely ruled out by pulmonary arteriogram. 
On hospital day number two the patient underwent a PA gram which revealed a mean RA pressure of 7 mm of mercury , a mean RV pressure of 12 mm of mercury , and no filling defects to suggest a pulmonary embolus. 
The day prior to obtaining the pulmonary arteriogram the patient had a good PA and lateral film , which revealed no focal infiltrates and no effusions. 
On hospital day number three the patient underwent an echocardiogram which revealed normal left ventricular size and mild left ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous function and no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
She had no pericardial thickening or pericardial effusion to suggest pericarditis. 
She had structurally normal cardiac valves , no significant mitral or tricuspid regurge. 
At this point , given the fact that the patient was not felt to have a myocardial infarction , given her low MB total CK ratio , and also that she was not felt to have a pulmonary embolus , given the negative PA gram , the diagnosis of pleurisy secondary to possible close viral syndrome was considered. 
There were no complications.

RECORD #255
She denied complaints of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. 
She denied any other pain. 
Her heart was tachycardic , but no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Her urinalysis was dark , with 3+ leukoesterase , negative nitrates , greater than 200 white blood cells per high peripheral , 2-4 red blood cells per high peripheral , 1+ bacteria. 
Her left bundle branch block with a QTc of 500 , but no change compared to baseline. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for initial presentation with somnolence and altered mental status with one hypotensive blood pressure by EMS , but subsequently no hypotension in the absence of fluid resuscitation. 
However , her urine culture did not grow any bacteria , it only drew out yeast. 
Thus , she was transitioned over to a ciprofloxacin 700 mg p.o. b.i.d. regime for a total of 12 days for a presumed urinary tract infection. 
She did not have any other metabolic abnormality that required correction. 
4. Heme/Oncology: The patient has a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy and is followed by her outpatient oncologist , as well as the outpatient psychosocial oncology social worker , as well as the psychosocial oncology physician whose name is Gaylene Faniel . 
However , she would intermittently loose track of where her location was and believed that she was in Teran Skinver Careteher Hospital , not in the hospital. 
It was considered initially that her altered mental status was due to polypharmacy. 
The psychiatric consultants also suggested a one-to-one sitter. 
At no time was the patient actively suicidal or homicidal. 
In addition , the patient's family also suggested that the patient's base mental status did not improve despite removing all the medications. 
Given the patient's history of complex seizures and olfactory hallucinations , she was continued on her Lamictal , as well as her Cymbalta , which was for her history of depression. 
She could not specifically describe this pain. 
7. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on Novolog sliding scale for diabetes.

Discharge Date: 10/10/2004 ATTENDING: JERICA TANYA YOUNGBERG MD HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was admitted on 9/14/04 for a right plantar surface neurotrophic ulcer secondary to diabetes mellitus. 
The patient has a long-standing history of peripheral neuropathy and slight history of peripheral vascular disease. 
The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , distant past of pancreatitis , gout , neuropathy , high cholesterol , and chronic renal insufficiency. 
On cardiac examination had a slight murmur 2/6 along the left sternal border and otherwise had a obese abdomen. 
The extremities and back revealed no abnormalities except for a right foot ulcer along the fourth and fifth metatarsal distal heads. 
Although , this dye was gadolinium , which is sued commonly for MRA and is not usually associated with any soft of renal toxicities. 
The patient tolerated the procedure without any problems and the patient control was adequate by postoperative day 1. However on postoperative lab checkup , it was see that the patient's creatinine bumped to 4.9 with a BUN of 61. 
At this point , the renal service was consulted for further input as far as possible causes of acute renal failure in the phase of chronic renal insufficiency and postoperative period. 
It was summarized by the renal team as well as by the surgical service and that the patient may have not been taking his medication at home and now was being his medications , while here in the hospital. 
This patient's blood glucose control was evaluated by the diabetes management service and it was summarized by them that the patient's renal insufficiency had a significant role in the patient's hypoglycemic episodes and that he ended up having insulin toxicity due to poor creatinine clearance and renal functioning level. 
The high that the patient reached was 5.6 of potassium on the same day that he had a creatine of 8.3 , which was on postoperative day #2 , This was treated with kayexalate and along the same lines , the patient's medications were evaluated and it was decided to decrease it to b.i.d. dosing and to start holding lisinopril , Neurontin , and vancomycin for their possible renal toxic effects. 
At the same time , an MRA of the renal arteries was obtained which revealed no stenosis lesions of the kidneys. 
The diabetes management service , the physical therapy , and the renal teams continued to follow the patient closely during the duration of his stay until it was felt that the patient's postoperative complications and issues including blood glucose control as well as renal insufficiency were under control. 
The patient was seen by Dr. Ditommaso in the renal staff and by the diabetes management service by Dr. Shirlene Lorson , pager #125-41.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42-year-old white man who presents with complaints of fever to 103 and chills , a productive cough and groin pain lasting three days. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Wilms' tumor , ( 2 ) status post left nephrectomy with wide field radiation therapy , ( 3 ) NCH renal disease status post living related donor renal transplant from father in April 1997 , ( 4 ) hypertension , ( 5 ) insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , ( 6 ) pulmonary hypertension , ( 7 ) hyperthyroid , ( 8 ) hyperparathyroid , ( 9 ) hypertriglyceridemia , ( 10 ) gout , ( 11 ) CMV infection in February 1997 and August 1997 , ( 12 ) history of perirectal abscess , ( 13 ) history of atrial fibrillation spontaneously converted in October 1998. 
He denies alcohol or tobacco use. 
Blood cultures on admission revealed no growth and on hospital day two revealed no growth. 
Wound cultures revealed few coagulase , negative staph. 
The patient subsequently had no fever spikes , however , on hospital day three Levaquin was initiated and intravenous antibiotics were continued until hospital day four. 
2. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has a history of hypertension and has been maintained on nadolol , recently requiring a doubling in his dose from 40 mg q.d. to 80 mg q.d. 
The patient also carries a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension , presumed from the February 1997 , results of his echocardiogram. 
The results of this study revealed 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation , unchanged from prior studies and a pulmonary arterial pressure of approximately 45 mmHg , also not notably changed. 
This was evaluated with a chest radiogram , which revealed possibility of a right sided pulmonary process , corroborated on examination by evidence of crackles half way up. 
Studies for CMV antigen and CMV from the buffy coat were sent and the final results revealed a positive CMV antigen , but a negative buffy coat. 
However , in his hospital course this did not continue to be an issue. 
The patient carries a history of multiple endocrine issues including hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism , diabetes mellitus , hyperthyroidism on thyroid replacement therapy following subtotal thyroidectomy , and possibility of mineral corticoid deficiency. 
In addition , they recommended a bone densitometry study for evaluation of his bone mass following chronic maintenance on the steroid therapy and a history of hyperparathyroidism. 
The team thought that the patient's previous question of a mineral corticoid deficiency was likely due to his prior Cozaar therapy. 
They did not fell it was necessary at this point to preform a cortizone stimulation study or to further assess this possibility of a mineral corticoid deficiency.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Rule out MI. PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Angina , tachycardia , and hypertension. 
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Hypertension , chest pain , GERD , coronary artery disease , osteoarthritis , anxiety , diverticulosis , hypercholesterolemia , and chronic dizziness. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 80-year-old woman with history of coronary artery disease and difficult to control hypertension who presented with chest pain in the setting of the elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. 
She was taken to the Pagham University Of ED. Of note , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days. 
Of note , the patient has had an identical admission several months earlier for a labile blood pressure. 
During that admission , the patient's hydralazine and beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressure control. 
She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renal artery stenosis. 
She was discharged at that point on an improved antihypertensive regimen as described above. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , angina , osteoarthritis , GERD , diverticulosis , hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post CABG x4 and multiple stents , chronic dizziness , stable cath 8/4 .  
SOCIAL HISTORY: No smoking , no ethanol. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: 1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the setting of not taking her Toprol. 
She does have a history of labile blood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. 
This symptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , but this was ruled out last admission. 
Renal artery stenosis was also ruled out last admission. 
Given the description and the fact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previous admission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudo pheochromocytoma. 
She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and was discharged home without any dizziness or nausea.

He has also experienced worsening peripheral vascular disease. 
In this context , he was admitted to Pagham University Of approximately one month ago , when on May , he underwent debridement of diabetic foot ulcers and amputation of the right fifth toe. 
He states this glucose levels have been doing well , although he is not able to cite any numbers. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Hypertension. 2 ) Peripheral vascular disease. 3 ) Type II diabetes mellitus. 
Alcohol: denies alcohol intake in the last six weeks; history of previous heavy alcohol use. 
He is currently disabled and is not working. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Hypertension , but no known history of cardiac events. 
PSYCHIATRIC: Admits to some depression. 
There are no palpable nodes. 
EXTREMITIES: There is no edema. 
The first metatarsal joint has a 1.2 centimeter wound which is dry , tender and not erythematous outside of its margins , boggy at the distal aspect. 
There is no surrounding erythema or bogginess. 
He tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively progressed without complications. 
The patient has begun to increase his activity with the guidance of the physical therapist , and is now moving on crutches with touch down weight bearing of the right foot and no weight bearing on the right side. 
There were no complications during this admission. 
This was followed by an Ophthalmology consult , during which it was determined that there has likely been a gradual decline in the patient's vision due to a combination of development of cataracts as well as peripheral vascular disease.

No history of thalassemia that the patient knows of. 
Speech and mentation were normal. 
No lymphadenopathy. 
Abdomen: Obese , soft , nondistended , nontender , benign. 
ADMISSION DATA: BNP of 1111 , creatinine was 2.4 which was below her baseline of 2.6 to 2.8 , white count was 6.6 with no left shift , hematocrit was 35.7 which is up from her baseline of 27 to 33. MCV was 67.4 which is stable and it has been in this range and she was found to have in 5/25 a monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP. 
Echo in 5/25 showed an EF of 50 to 55% with moderate-to-severe MR and TR , septal hypokinesis and a MIBI at that time showed no reversible ischemia. 
Because of her visual problems and declining physical condition and deconditioning , patient's current living situation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for her increasing needs and error in self administration of medications or increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may have precipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status. 
Pleural effusion on the right decreased only minimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent a thoracentesis on 3/1/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellow fluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with a sterile transudative effusion. 
Cultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may be repeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining of the effusion. 
Creatinine is at a baseline of 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possibly because of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her ACE inhibitor. 
Endocrinology: The patient was admitted with hypoglycemic diabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and social barriers. 
Cardiac: A. Pump: The patient with CHF , known valvular dysfunction , exhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea. 
She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and it was noted that her weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. 
She continued her Lipitor and aspirin , atenolol was changed metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. 
Lisinopril was switched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumping creatinine while diuresing on the ACE inhibitor. 
Lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and the patient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked and repleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday no more than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is able to maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime. 
Heme: The patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosis which might suggest thalassemia. 
She is on iron and Epogen with an improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change in her MCV , which suggests that she has more than renal disease causing her microcytosis. 
Further workup of her monoclonal gammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician. 
6. Aspirin325 mg p.o. q.d. 7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Lisinopril should be held for the moment. 
She should b switched to Toprol as her blood pressure tolerates and to lisinopril as her creatinine tolerates after low-level diuresis of about 50 cc to one liter a day.

RECORD #309
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with chest pain syndrome and known coronary artery disease admitted with increasing exertional dyspnea , thought to be his anginal equivalent. 
He was admitted for medical management and possible laser angioplasty of an occluded left circumflex coronary artery. 
Cardiac catheterization , at that time , demonstrated 100% occlusion of the left circumflex artery which was heavily calcified and not amenable to balloon angioplasty. 
The patient had no chest discomfort or ECG changes during the exercise test. 
At home , the patient reports that he has not been exercising as frequently as he used to and his exercise regimen usually consisted of 15 minutes on a ski machine three times a week. 
This probably represents a reflux disease. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an elderly gentleman in no apparent distress. 
Cardiovascular examination was significant for an S4 , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs. 
His extremities had no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 76-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery disease , known occlusion of the left circumflex with an exercise tolerance test one year ago without evidence for ischemia. 
He stopped secondary to dyspnea on exertion and leg fatigue with no chest pain. 
On July , 1996 , he underwent cardiac catheterization with laser assisted PTCA of his left circumflex lesion , which he tolerated well. 
His post catheterization course was slightly complicated by increased bleeding from the groin site , as well as the possible development of a hematoma versus pseudoaneurysm as a bruit was heard in the right groin. 
This was evaluated with a vascular ultrasound which showed no hematoma and no pseudoaneurysm. 
His blood pressure medications were manipulated for better control of his significant hypertension , as well as for increased outpatient compliance. 
However , the patient felt that he did not need to take this and refused it. 
His medical team felt that it was more important for him to be compliant with his hypertension and cardiac medications , at this juncture , and the issue of restarting glyburide will be brought up in the outpatient setting by Dr. Fiermonte . 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.day , Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingually q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and pen-VK 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. times five days.

She had an exercise tolerance test at that time where she went nine minutes with non-diagnostic changes. 
She went 7 minutes and 33 seconds stopping because of shortness of breath with non-diagnostic changes and demonstrated reperfusion defects. 
Her Dl was reduced from 90% to 20% without complications. 
This continued to progress , always symptoms occurring with exertion with several episodes of pain on the day of admission not associated with shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or radiation. 
This was because she did not have her Nitroglycerin with her and was unable to take any medication. 
Patient denies any history of rest pain. 
In addition , the patient had some suggestion of difficulty sleeping at night requiring more pillows. 
However , she denies that this is related to her breathing.

ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. 
ECG demonstrated a sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with an axis of 0 , intervals of 0.l6/0.06/0.32 , and there were some T wave inversions in I and L with l mm ST depression that was upsloping in V4 through V6 without significant change from March , l980. 
Patient did well after admission with no evident chest pain. 
There was some concern on admission with the story of difficulty sleeping at night raising the possibility of some congestive heart failure. 
However , throughout the admission , the patient showed no symptoms of this. 
The patient went for cardiac catheterization which demonstrated that she had , in fact , reoccluded her Dl vessel to 95% stenosis and of note , she also had her OMBl with a 50% lesion. 
Therefore , this procedure was not attempted. 
The patient underwent exercise tolerance test using the standard Bruce protocol and she went for six minutes and four seconds stopping because of shortness of breath denying any chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ON ADMISSION: This is a 73-year-old  female with known coronary artery disease , status post CABG , now with CHF of 30% and a long history of second hand smoke inhalation , who presented with shortness of breath. 
She did not have any chest pressure or pain , but she did have some shortness of breath and a cough productive of white sputum. 
She had no wheezing , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and no change in her eating habits. 
She denied any PND , DOE or orthopnea , and she had not noticed increased leg edema. 
No S3 or S4. Respiratory exam was significant for some wheezes , but no rales however. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease in which she had an acute myocardial infarction in 1995 for which a stent was placed in the LAD. 
The cardiac risk factors include hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and smoke inhalation history. 
The patient did not have chest pressure or pain at any moment of her hospitalization and did not need any nitroglycerin. 
She was continued on her statin , beta blocker , and ACE inhibitor , and aspirin. 
It was determined that since 7/26 there had been no significant interval change. 
There were no issues. 
Finally , azithromycin was added so as to possibly treat any atypical pneumonia as the patient had only some interstitial pattern on her chest x-ray , and did not have any focal area of consolidation. 
3. Endocrine: When the patient was admitted , she was maintained on her home dose regimen for diabetes mellitus. 
Because a finger stick blood glucose and insulin sliding scale did not fully control her blood glucose. 
She at one point began to have an non-gap metabolic acidosis. 
Anticipating possible decay , she was started on regular lab draws and insulin drips. 
She did not have any potassium , fluid or other complications.

Discharge Date: ATTENDING: GWYNETH ALMEDA DEPSKY MD Ms. Debrita is a 90+-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease including a non ST elevation MI in 4/13 medically managed , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 who was transferred from the Norap Valley Hospital with shortness of breath several days after discharge from that hospital where she was treated for , a multilevel pneumonia and CHF exacerbation. 
She had been hospitalized at P Therford Hospital where she was treated for pneumonia and after treatment had returned to her rehabilitation facility/skilled nursing facility where she was not eating and was found to be very tachypneic and diaphoretic and tachycardiac for the three days prior to admission here. 
The patient received diuresis , had a chest MRA to rule out pulmonary embolism , which was negative and was transferred to Pagham University Of for telemetry. 
She had no lower extremity edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: There was no evidence of acute ischemia. 
In terms of her rhythm , in addition to the asymptomatic bradycardia , she did have several runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. 
The electrophysiology was consulted and they did not feel that any intervention was indicated given the asymptomatic nature of her arrhythmias. 
In terms of her congestive heart failure exacerbation was thought to be the primary reason for her tachypnea and dyspnea. 
Because a recurrence of her pneumonia cannot be ruled out , we will complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl , which was added for the concern of aspiration to add anaerobic coverage. 
The patient will also be discharged on the salicylic acid 81 mg , Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin was given for prophylaxis as an inpatient , but she should be treated according to NH policies , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , multivitamin , simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 10 mEq x1 p.o. q.d. , and Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old , morbidly obese gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors transferred from Ogea Medical Center after presenting there with a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of chest pain , having ruled in for a myocardial infarction with several subsequent VT/VF arrests. 
He has a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and former tobacco use. 
He was put on maximal medications , and his most recent exercise tolerance test in 4/06 was not as positive as previously , but still suggestive of ischemia. 
He did not require intubation. 
He had another episode of VT two hours later which deteriorated into VF , again requiring cardioversion sinus bradycardia. 
On arrival , he denied chest pain. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , orthopedic problems including severe shoulder dislocations as a child with chronic shoulder osteoarthritis and a recent meniscal tear of the knee. 
He was seen in catheterization and found to have a complex LAD stenosis that was 60% in the mid and 70% in the distal LAD , 40% proximal left circumflex , 70% complex stenosis in the OM2 , and an occluded RCA. 
He had no further chest pain or ectopy on the TNG , lidocaine , and beta blockers , and he was successfully diuresed. 
Given these findings , he was taken to the Operating Room on 1/26/96 , at which time he had a coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to the LAD , and a saphenous vein graft to the OM1 and to the PDA. 
However , postoperatively , on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit , he did not require any further pacing. 
Because of his obesity , he required a big boy bed and he was seen by physical therapy to improve his mobilization. 
He was successfully weaned off oxygen and was ambulating by the time of discharge without any trouble. 
The patient's stay , however , was prolonged by evidence of cellulitis , particularly of his right saphenous vein graft site. 
There was no breakdown or discharge , however , there was erythema and warmth , which was treated with IV antibiotics ( ultimately Ancef IV ) and elevation.

1-Epistaxis: may be secondary to anti-coagulation vs underlying blood dyscrasia vs allergic rhinitis vs recurrence of previous epistaxis ( possible AVM ) vs longstanding HTN vs tumor. 
Pt had another episode of nosebleed/clot while an inpatient , but no uncontrollable bleeding. 
There was no need to tamponade pt's nares , however , in light of her hx of menorrhagia , previous DVT/PE , and family hx of DVT's , it will be important to assess for different causes of hyper/hypocoagulability in this pt as an outpt ( platelet d/o , von willebrand's disorder , hemophilia , osler-weber-rendu d/o ). 
It will be also important to assess for possible nasal AVM or ?tumor( low likelihood ). 
She needs to be followed up for compliance and understanding of importance of BP control , as patient was not compliant on medications on presentation , had very high BP on presentation. 
An Echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but EF was 65% , no effusions were found , and there was only mild MR. Pt does not have an official DM dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk for glucose intolerance , thus a HbA1C will need to be obtained as an outpatient. 
Pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipid profile was obtained. 
Pt also has a hx of GERD , thus the c/p may have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or GERD as it radiated to the back and right shoulder. 
Pt denies having had spicy foods or nausea/vomiting before the episodes , however. 
Pt had chest tenderness along the sternum and L ribcage , which may have contributed to her feeling of c/p. 
She should continue a low choles/fat , and no salt added diet. 
This was probably due to not using your blood pressure medications regularly. 
You must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , low fat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressure or even lead to heart failure. 
2. We recommend that the patient have a pharmacologic stress test as an outpatient to evaluate for possible areas of potential cardiac ischemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old female with multiple medical problems , including coronary artery disease , status post stent to the left circumflex in 1999 , silent MI in 1990 , hypertension , type II diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , who presented to an outside hospital with acute onset of shortness of breath that occurred while the patient was watching T.V. This dyspnea was associated with chest heaviness , but the patient denies nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation. 
She has no PND or palpitations. 
She further denies fevers , chills , constipation , nausea , vomiting , cough , bright red blood per rectum , melena , or dysuria. 
The patient denies diet or medicine indiscretion. 
The patient has had no further chest pain or shortness of breath since the day she was admitted to the outside hospital.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco use for the past 13 years. 
The patient reports rare alcohol use and denies any drug use. 
GENERAL: The patient is alert and oriented x3 , pleasant female sitting in the bed in no apparent distress. 
ABDOMEN: Obese , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended. 
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
Urinalysis showed 1+ protein , 3+ blood , 2+ leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 35-40 white cells , 80-85 red cells , 1+ bacteria , 1+ epi , no casts. 
EKG , on admission , showed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 , LVH with probable strain laterally. 
Of note , an EKG done at the outside hospital on 2/10 showed inverted Ts in I , L , and V2-V6. 
When this had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed an occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. 
There were , therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either of the stent or of one of her other vessels. 
She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she underwent cardiac catheterization. 
The results of this study were as follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid D1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior catheterization. 
The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling with collaterals from left to right. 
There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis. 
However , no other renal disease was noted. 
She had no new EKG changes and no chest pain. 
The MIBI portion of the test showed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct ischemia involving 3-5 segments. 
The most likely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction given her age and history of diabetes. 
Dr. Raabe is interested in enrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor blockers in treatment of this disorder. 
Her right ventricle size and function is normal. 
Please note that an addendum to this discharge summary will be added with the patient's discharge medications.

His heart was regular with S1 , S2 , S4 , and no murmurs. 
His extremities were notable for no edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient ruled out for MI. He had no complaints of chest pain at any time during his admission. 
Initially , his Lasix and lisinopril were held in the context of concern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episode of weakness. 
3. Endocrine: The patient's diabetes mellitus is very poorly controlled. 
After consideration of the risks and benefits of other oral agents including the high nature of his hemoglobin A1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would be necessary for adequate control of his diabetes. 
To begin with , he was discharged on standing dose of 6 units of NPH in the morning and 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposable insulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medication himself , but simply to select the correct dose and give the injection. 
4. Neuro: The patient's episode of blurred vision did not recur. 
It is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this. 
He did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admission that revealed no problems. 
He had no other neurologic or visual symptoms during his stay in the hospital. 
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Timoptic 0.5% one drop OU b.i.d. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d. , glipizide XL 10 mg p.o. q.d. , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH insulin 6 units subcutaneously q.a.m.

RECORD #375
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 62-year-old male with morbid obesity , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , prior MI presents with increased lower extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion over the last several months. 
Whereas , he used to be able to walk 40 to 50 feet without shortness of breath , he is now only able to walk 10 feet. 
In the emergency department , he got his home CPAP , was noted on chest x-ray ( of poor quality ) to have a question of a left lower lobe consolidation and therefore received one dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. 
Therefore the patient was felt to have also an element of volume overload and he was admitted to the renal service for consideration of dialysis and volume removal. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Diabetes type II. 3. Morbid obesity. 
8. BPH. 9. Prior MI ( was not able to cath due to body habitus ). 
He is in no apparent distress. 
There is no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
Abdomen is markedly obese with significant lateral edema particularly on the left side where his pannus tends to fall. 
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacification , but the patient was not able to stand for a lateral chest x-ray. 
his focal segmental glomerular sclerosis , diabetes , and hypertension. 
2. Pulmonary: The patient continued to wear his CPAP for his severe obstructive sleep apnea. 
His breathing improved somewhat during his hospitalization but it was not possible to tell how well he would do if he would attempt to walk again as he was sedentary and in bed for his entire hospitalization except for occasionally sitting up on the side of the bed and moving to a bed chair once or twice. 
3. Infectious Disease: There was not clear evidence of pneumonia critically or on review of the chest x-ray and therefore the patient was not specifically treated for pneumonia. 
However , upon placement of a Foley catheter , there was a significant amount of white blood cells in the urine and while the urine culture appeared not to be negative , the patient was treated with a 10-day course of levofloxacin ( renally adjusted ) for urinary tract infection. 
4. Cardiovascular: A. Rhythm: The patient was maintained on sotalol and a beta-blocker for his prior history of ventricular tachycardia. 
He did not have any episodes while inhouse on this hospitalization. 
The patient's electrophysiologist Dr. Denisha H Mcrorie suggested that given that the patient is on hemodialysis , the sotalol should be reduced to 40 mg three times a week to be given approximately two hours after dialysis. 
B. Ischemia: He is much ruled out for MI. He was maintained on aspirin , statin , and a beta-blocker.

PROBLEMS: Diabetes , atrial fibrillation , CHF , acute renal failure , thrombocytopenia , elevated LFTs , agitation , aspiration and rheumatoid arthritis. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Eisenzimmer is a 71-year-old woman with severe obesity who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure from a rehabilitation facility for rapid shallow breathing. 
Of note , she had a recent admission to Pande Memorial Hospital for sepsis secondary to cellulitis and pneumonia , enjoying that admission she developed ATN secondary to antibiotic use. 
ROS on arrival to the medicine floor is not possible , as the patient is disoriented ( at baseline ). 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. COPD , for which she uses BiPAP at home and no oxygen. 
Ejection fraction is 55% with no wall motion abnormalities. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Fluconazole , prednisone 20 mg p.o. daily , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily , aspirin , atorvastatin , Imdur , Lasix , Norvasc , lisinopril , atenolol , Advair , DuoNebs , multivitamin , folate , calcium , Lispro sliding scale , NPH insulin , senna , Colace and oxycodone. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 99.1 , heart rate 69 , blood pressure 149/77 with an oxygen saturation of 99% on 100% nonrebreather. 
Morbidly obese. 
JVP cannot be assessed secondary to obesity. 
She did subsequently aspirate on secretions ( she was not eating at that time ) and became acutely hypoxic with an ABG that showed a pH of 7.45 , pCO2 of 48 and a PO2 of 36. 
Much of this diuresis was without pharmacological intervention , although she did receive minimal Lasix support. 
At the time of discharge , she was tending towards euvolemic or dry and was not on any Lasix. 
Therefore , the patient is not discharged on Coumadin. 5. Acute renal failure. 
Of note , her urine was positive for eosinophils on admission. 
The patient is noted to have a chronic thrombocytopenia. 
7. LFT abnormalities. 
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was within normal limits , although was of poor quality given the patient's obese body habitus. 
She does have a possible cholestatic picture , but the patient had no other symptoms. 
Given her DNR/DNI status with hospice services pending , no further workup was performed. 
Exam is notable for morbid obesity , coarse breath sounds , right greater than left , large ecchymosis of varying stages particularly at subcutaneous injection sites , and baseline disorientation , which is not different from the patient's usual mental status.

Unfortunately he has not responded to even 180 mg p.o. Lasix q day. 
He does not have symptoms of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
He has had 2 episodes of chest pain in September of 2002 for which he was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction , at that time MIBI was negative. 
He denies any palpitations on this admission. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old gentleman with diastolic dysfunction , congestive heart failure , nephrotic syndrome who has failed oral diuretics. 
He had a negative BNP suggesting the nephrotic syndrome to be the major cause of his shortness of breath more than congestive heart failure. 
Of note , this nephrotic syndrome is likely due to long standing diabetes induced nephropathy. 
The plan will be for him to get daily weights and he will be followed by a congestive heart failure nurse. 
2. Respiratory: The patient has no dyspnea or respiratory distress on discharge.

RECORD #390
Cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use in the past , hypercholesterolemia , and early menopause with no estrogen replacement. 
She was admitted on 11/10/95 with complaint of chest pain at rest without associated symptoms. 
There was no complaint of decreased exercise tolerance , exertional symptoms. 
It recurred intermittently without associated symptoms , no EKG changes. 
The concern was for a question of unequal blood pressures in the patient and complaint of back pain. 
A GEE was done to rule out aortic dissection. 
On GEE there were no valvular abnormalities or evidence for dissection and no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
On the evening of admission on 7/25/95 she again had the acute onset of sharp , burning , mid-epigastric versus sternal pain without radiation and with associated shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea , and an acid taste. 
Abdomen: Soft but obese. 
There was a slight upper concavity and ST-T segment in V2 and V3 when compared to old although this could be consistent with J point elevation and a question of a 0.5 mm segment elevation in V2. 
The EKG was without change from previous admission. 
The GEE was a suboptimal study and it was deemed more appropriate on admission to both rule the patient out but consider a pharmacologic stress test before cathing this patient. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Since the patient's symptoms did sound more gastrointestinal , she was started on Axid for possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as provided with Maalox and told to keep the head of the bed elevated. 
She was continued on Glucotrol for diabetes mellitus and was instructed on risk factor modifications , including diabetes mellitus control , controlling cholesterol and hypertension. 
She is currently a non-smoker. 
On the day following admission the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzyme sets respectively. 
EKGs were without change. 
MIBI images were notable for a fixed mild reduced uptake in the inferior wall consistent with but not diagnostic for myocardial injury. 
There were no reversible perfusion abnormalities detected. 
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Oaxaca as an outpatient for further workup and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as following her for her cardiac disease via the risk factor modification.

He had a complete occlusion of vein graft to RCA , 50% occlusion of vein graft to D2. He was also noted to have pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 48 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 33. 
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. 
At this stage due to his ongoing hemodynamic instability , he was paralysed with Nimbex , and his nitric oxide was increased for ongoing pulmonary hypertension. 
Mr. Araldi died at 7:30 p.m. on 5/23/06 from multiple organ failure secondary to complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy and placement of ventricular assist device.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Clostridium difficile colitis and ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
OTHER DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE: Congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; hypertension; atrial fibrillation; diabetes type 2; end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis; history of urinary tract infections; and benign prostatic hypertrophy. 
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 73-year-old gentleman with end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who was treated for C. difficile colitis and worsening CHF. 
The patient has a long history of ESRD secondary to hypertension and diabetes. 
He also has a long history of peripheral vascular disease status post right carotid endarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as well as atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA diagnosed by MRI with the timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from his atrial fibrillation. 
In fact , he currently cannot even get through his HPI without 3- to 5-word dyspnea. 
He has no nausea or vomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominal pain. 
The patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred to the unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to have right subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in the left arm. 
The decision was made not to catheterize , as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel disease and not a surgical candidate. 
He was found to have Clostridium difficile colitis and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. 
His course was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction on January , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likely demand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failure setting. 
The patient was managed medically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestive heart failure. 
His stool did grow out Staphylococcus aureus , but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , and therefore , we are not treating. 
After EGD , consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. 
He will take Nepro if asked. 
He had an NSTEMI on January , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demand ischemia from CHF. Continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin. 
A decision was made not to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel disease. 
We think this is okay not to cover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s. 
There was no parenchymal disease. 
There was routinely no consolidation or interstitial disease seen. 
We questioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to 96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growth to date. 
You could consider a third generation cephalosporin if a pneumonia develops. 
8. He has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far. 
p.r.n. headache; aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Peridex Mouthwash 0.12% b.i.d.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. every Sunday , Wednesday , and Friday; Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.; nystatin swish and swallow; Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.p.m.; Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; and Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d.

On admission , the patient did not report that the lower extremity edema felt worse than he normally feels at his baseline , however , he had developed some left upper extremity edema as well as his lower extremity edema. 
He also described a new shortness of breath on admission , a cough with whitish sputum , no blood in his cough. 
He denied dyspnea on exertion , but did report being short of breath while lying flat , or orthopnea. 
The patient denied any nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain or pressure. 
No palpitations , and no dyspnea on exertion. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for end-stage renal disease , aortic valve replacement in 6/24 , left buttock ulcer , also followed by Plastic Surgery , hypertension , diabetes mellitus type II , congestive heart failure , and hypercholesterolemia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , prednisone 20 mg daily , valacyclovir 400 mg daily , calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily , metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , Bactrim single strength daily , NPH 16 units q.a.m. , 18 units q.p.m. , NovoLog 6 units q.a.c. with sliding scale , Nexium 20 mg daily , Colace 100 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , multivitamin , and tramadol 50 mg q.i.d. 
ALLERGIES: He reports no known drug allergies. 
No cervical lymphedema , and no icterus. 
He did not have any carotid bruits. 
He had no focal deficits. 
On admission , we held the patient's anticoagulation for a possible biopsy of his kidney. 
The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
He had four-beat runs of NSVT on the day of admission , which he did not repeat after repletion of his electrolytes. 
He was given Lopressor x1 , he ruled out once again. 
The pain that he had developed was thought to be likely incisional and not cardiac. 
He was not diuresing effectively with more than 360 mg with IV Lasix , which was administered to him in the emergency department , so Renal was called urgently to see him in observation and he was sent for urgent dialysis. 
Blood cultures grew 4/4 Gram-negative rods , and the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis. 
6. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Nexium throughout his hospital stay and we held his anticoagulation for possible biopsy. 
He was able to leave the floor for cigarettes , and he signed an agreement suggesting that he was going to tolerate the risk of leaving the floor for short period of time even while on telemetry.

RECORD #397
In the emergency room , the patient was noted to have a BNP of 519 and was initially treated with Lasix in the emergency room , and was admitted at that point for diagnosis of COPD exacerbation in the setting of an upper respiratory infection in addition to mild congestive heart failure. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , requiring at least two prior intubations; congestive heart failure , previously thought to be diastolic with an EF of 50%; diabetes , hypertension , history of upper GI bleed in 5/20 secondary to an antral ulcer , pneumonia in 7/20 left lower lobe nodule , which is stable on followup CTs; chronic renal insufficiency , thought secondary to diabetes and hypertension. 
Father had congestive heart failure. 
MCV was low at 80. Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema , no infiltrates. 
EKG showed no acute changes from prior. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 65-year-old male with history of COPD who is admitted for a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a likely viral URI as well as some mild congestive heart failure exacerbation. 
The patient continued to improve , and on 9/3/2005 , he was able to ambulate on room air without dyspnea or hypoxia. 
At this point , we suggest outpatient pulmonary function tests to further evaluate the extent of the patient's obstructive disease. 
The patient has not had any ischemic symptoms; however , this marked decrease is concerning especially including the inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis , which is new from his prior echocardiogram. 
The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin. 
The patient is noted to have relatively stable pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 50 plus right atrial pressure. 
The patient was continued on a beta-blocker as well. 
In addition , the patient was noted to have significant hypertension. 
He has had a workup previously for secondary causes of hypertension , which included a negative MRA in 2004. 
The patient was continued on a clonodine patch as well as beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , and Imdur. 
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and therefore was continued on a regimen of NPH initially at 20 units b.i.d. 
The patient was also noted to have hyperparathyroidism likely from renal disease , therefore secondary versus tertiary hyperparathyroidism. 
There was no anion gap. 
They did not feel that there was any indication for acute renal replacement. 
DISCHARGE DIET: Mechanical soft , thin , no added salt , ADA 2100 calories per day , renal diet.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Eguia is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post a myocardial infarction in September 1995. 
He has been subsequently followed as an outpatient without recurrence of his anginal symptoms. 
He is without current myocardial infarction. 
The results of the exercise tolerance test were not available at the time of admission here. 
There was a question of an irregular heartbeat during his exercise and he stopped the procedure secondary to fatigue. 
At 2 a.m. on the day of admission , the patient experienced a substernal chest pain as a dull ache without radiation. 
He had no other associated symptoms. 
He does not associate the pain with any particular level of exertion , that it can happen sitting still or with activity without any particular pattern. 
It was not relieved with rest or after one to two tabs of sublingual nitroglycerin. 
Hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times five years , diet controlled , and nasal polyps. 
He has not done this since this summer.

LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Atrial fibrillation , venous stasis. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure and lower extremity edema who was admitted to Pagham University Of with increased calf swelling , weight gain , leg pain and malaise. 
She denies any increasing shortness of breath. 
She has had no chest pain , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
She always sleeps with the head of her bed elevated , but generally has not noted any problem with lying flat. 
She has had no cough , no fevers and chills. 
No dysuria , no diarrhea , no nausea or vomiting. 
In the emergency department , she had lower extremity non-invasive ultrasound studies , which were negative for DVT and a urinalysis revealed UTI.

Heart exam revealed regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border with no radiation. 
Heart exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 , S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border with no radiation. 
Extremities revealed extensive bilateral edema with chronic venous stasis pigmentary changes and brawny erythremia of the lower shins. 
DP and PT pulses were not palpable , but feet were 1. LABORATORY DATA: Labs at admission were notable for creatinine of 1.3 , which was consistent with her baseline , creatinine and the white blood count of 11.5. 
EKG was completely V-paced rate of 80. HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: In summary , this is an 87-year-old woman admitted with leg pain and swelling and weight gain likely secondary to chronic venous stasis and with general malaise due to urinary tract infection. 
The patient was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin and a urine culture was sent , which had no growth at the time of discharge , but was not yet finalized. 
2. Cardiovascular , the patient has symptoms of total body volume overloaded in her lower extremities; however , she had symptoms of left-sided heart failure and it is likely the swelling in her legs is more secondary to chronic venous stasis than to right-sided heart failure per se. 
The patient's cord status is do not resuscitate , do not intubate.

Discharge Date: 3/8/2005 ATTENDING: HORNBEAK , LAUREL MD HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Caruth is a 65-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity , bilateral leg swelling , palpitations , remote seizure disorder last one in 1981 , obstructive sleep apnea , has started CPAP in 4/10/2005 , and migraines. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke. 
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denied initial drug surgery. 
Left hemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descending thoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively , and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag and partial VAC sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors. 
On 6/10/2005 , a TEE was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and no major regional wall motion abnormalities. 
On 11/28/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound for again a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidence of hydronephrosis. 
He was sent down for the CT of the abdomen and pelvis , and now the J tube was not fully visualized I think because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast was not seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tube feeds safely which we have with no problems. 
On 6/16/2005 , he desaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the left upper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the left upper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed. 
TEE at the bedside show no dissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. 
Today , he was planning to go to hemodialysis in order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that it is not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia we would like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. 
He has been able to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 units of heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the catheters to flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremity either ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in the left upper extremity due to the increased swelling. 
He right now is on no major mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. 
The beta-blocker that he was initially on Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenem desensitization the feeling being that if he did has an anaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed action and we did not want any beta-blocker on board. 
Gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates very well and there are no issues any more with the J-tube position. 
We are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult , though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream with absolutely no problems on p.o. He is also on Pepcid IV for GI prophylaxis. 
The first dose was given in the a.m. on 10/3/2005 , and there are no new culture results after the gram-negative enterobacter was found.

The patient has a long history of coronary artery disease starting in 1989. 
The patient presented with angina and ruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. 
The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in February of 1992 which was complicated by ventricular fibrillation arrest in the postoperative Intensive Care Unit. 
On the day of admission today , for this admission , the patient experienced chest burning at rest while watching TV with no emotional or exertional stress. 
The patient took a shower without relief , took five sublingual Nitroglycerin tablets without relief. 
The patient had no nausea or vomiting , diaphoresis or shortness of breath. 
The patient has had no increasing dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea or PND recently; however the patient is not physically active. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese , pleasant male in no distress. 
There was a 1/6 holosystolic murmur with no radiation. 
The patient's chest x-ray was of poor quality , with no congestive heart failure and mild cardiomegaly , and bibasilar atelectasis. 
The patient's EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 75 , Q waves in III and aVF , V1 and V2. ST elevations in III and aVF of one millimeter , ST depressions and T wave inversions in I and L , but no changes when compared to the patient's baseline EKG. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction , and given his extensive history of previous coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting , it was felt most likely that the patient is now developing an occlusion of his grafted vessels versus occlusion of his right coronary system. 
The patient experienced no chest pain after the procedure and EKGs had shown no changes after the procedure. 
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes and his Metformin was held before the catheterization procedure , and the patient was continued on insulin sliding scale and his Glyburide without complications.

PROBLEM LIST: 1. Congestive heart failure. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is a 64-year-old gentleman with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction in 1976 with resultant left ventricular aneurysm and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. 
On presentation on this admission , he did not have a history of angina , but did have a history of class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned above , includes also diabetes with oral treatment only , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia and gout. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable for a cholecystectomy in 80s and ICD placed via an open chest in 1990 , replacement in 1992 and in 1997 , appendectomy , right inguinal hernia repair in 1986. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for this gentleman who was 5 feet 10 inches and 95 kg in no acute distress. 
He had no detectable carotid bruits. 
His abdomen was notable for scars from a previous right cholecystectomy and a left lower quadrant incision for placement of ICD. 
There were no masses and the abdomen was soft and nontender. 
His extremities were without scaring or edema and he did not have varicosities present. 
Sedation was weaned and he was extubated without incident. 
He was neurologically intact throughout the course of his ICU stay and he was transferred to floor with no focal deficits , moving all extremities and pain that is well controlled. 
The esmolol did improve his rates slightly but did not significantly improve his cardiac output or his mixed venous oxygen saturation. 
He was given trial of ibutilide , which did not significantly change his rate or convert him into sinus rhythm. 
He remained in atrial fibrillation and did not convert to sinus. 
Transesophageal echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 30% and no clots in the atrial ventricles. 
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and hypothyroidism. 
He was seen by ID and his only positive blood culture was a coag-negative staph that was believe to be a contaminant. 
He was on vancomycin for many days that was not discontinued. 
He does have a history of right knee gout , which did flare while he was in the Intensive Care Unit and part of his elevated blood cell count was attributed to that.

RECORD #409
Discharge Date: 6/23/2004 ATTENDING: MARCELINA STRAUHAL MD The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the last FEV1 of 0.42 , congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately 40% , who was transferred from Toalemraanne Hermwill General Hospital for continued treatment for worsening shortness of breath. 
She noted that she is having a hard time even getting to the bathroom. 
She reports that she had a dry cough without any sputum production. 
No runny nose or sore throat. 
This is different from her usual COPD excerebration , in which it is no longer proceeded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. 
She would wakeup in the middle of the night when she was short of breath , but there was no change in that symptom over the previous months. 
She also notes that she had some diarrhea that was "like pudding" 1-3 times per day. 
Not watery , not bloody , and not black. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to aminophyllin. 
2. Congestive heart failure , April 2003. 
The ventricle is normal. 
There is mild aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation , normal atria , and normal tricuspid valve. 
4. Type II diabetes when she takes steroids. 
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
10. Lasix 40-60 mg each morning , which the patient had not been taking because it made her pee too much. 
12. Ritalin 5 mg every morning and at lunch , although she does not feel that it was benefiting her. 
Tylenol No.3 q.6h. 
She cannot speak in full sentences. 
Her jugular venous pressure was elevated , but with significant respiratory phasic variation. 
The patient's hand veins also revealed an increased venous pressure. 
The patient had no pallor and no jaundice. 
No crackles and no rhonchi. 
The abdomen was soft , , nontender , and nondistended. 
Extremities: There was no edema , nontender. 
They have no children. 
The patient has not used tobacco since 1984. 
She notes that she drinks one drink every month approximately. 
Her white count was 12 with 75% neutrophils , 3 eosinophils , and 6-12 bands forms. 
This was noted to be an arterial blood gas. 
QRS width was approximately 120 milliseconds in a left bundle branch pattern with normal axis. 
She had 1-2 mm ST-depression in 2 , 3 and AVF with T-wave inversions in those leads , also T-wave inversions with 1 mm ST depression in V5 and V6. 
However , this was unlike many of her previous exacerbations in that she did not experience any upper respiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venous pressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might be having a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well. 
However , she did have a decreased O2 saturation and her CO2 was not very elevated at the outside hospital. 
As this dictation is being done , the plan is for her either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at the hospital until she is fully ready and safe to go home , and is not at an increased fall risk given her severe osteoporosis. 
2. Cardiovascular: A. Pump: Initially , the patient was thought to possibly be volume overloaded given the fact that she was not taking her Lasix and that her JVP appeared elevated. 
In addition , there was some question whether she might has been having increasing paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea. 
However , lab results suggested that congestive heart failure was not a large part of her presentation. 
First , the brain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value of proximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 , suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of her heart failure. 
Her creatinine in the afternoon of March , 2004 , increased to 2.2. 
In terms of her heart failure , the patient was given IV fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heart failure. 
Her normal dose of 40 mg of Lasix p.o. every morning was restarted on September , 2004 , and she will be continued on that dose. 
B. Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and after her sinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemia improved and she had no further issues. 
She was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospastic response to that , but she was continued on her angiotensin receptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved. 
The patient will be monitored as an outpatient to make sure that her Lasix dose is not too high. 
Therefore , it was not felt that the patient had rhabdomyolysis causing renal failure , but rather renal failure causing retention of creatine kinase disease from increased work of breathing. 
A urinalysis was sent , which did not suggest that the patient had a urinary tract infection. 
The patient's TSH was 0.46 with a normal T4 of 7.8. 
She has no symptoms of gout. 
She was not continued on Ritalin and will not be discharged on her Ritalin given her tachycardia. 
In addition , the patient did not feel that the Ritalin was helping her. 
This will also not be one of her discharge medications and it should be reassessed by her primary care doctor.

He was re-admitted for nocturnal chest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy , suggesting that the elevated CK-MB and troponin were likely from myocarditis , as previously suspected. 
It was noted on his prior admission that he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended to protect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresing well to lasix. 
On the day after admission , he had one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicated pain in his RUQ. 
He had a repeat echo that showed no progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalent EF of 70-75%. 
He had several noctural few beat runs of NSVT , but no other significant events. 
3. Rhabdo: He has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevated CK , with possible contribution from cocaine. 
He was changed back to IV solumedrol on admission , and switched to PO solumedrol on discharge. 
His CK dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , and then hovered around that dose. 
His Cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission , likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly from over-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of BUN of 42. 
His lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellent symptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering at the time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatient dosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenal physiology. 
5. FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Mr Wasmus You were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined by looking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you have not had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. 
He will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt to identify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making him pre-renal.

Discharge Date: 4/22/2003 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting , mitral valve replacement with previous history of endocarditis in April 2002 who presents with severe back pain. 
On Monday he again had severe pain , came to the emergency department here at Pagham University Of where he had a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities. 
He was urged by his cardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule out epidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting , status post myocardial infarction , mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude valve , congestive heart failure , history of endocarditis , history of hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy. 
CT scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative for abscess. 
The patient had no fevers. 
His admission exam was benign with no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. 
There was variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain to palpation over the spine. 
On October , 2003 a transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for vegetation. 
A MRI of the spine was negative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI did show severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing the patient's back pain. 
The patient has had numerous positive blood cultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , blood cultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative work up including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negative transesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negative abdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative tagged white blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. 
Dental consult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic source from the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicion for an oral source. 
There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gums that occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing from poor dentition and gum care. 
The patient was on Neurontin and OxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting on Baclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persists outside the treatment of endocarditis. 
3. The pain is likely secondary at least partially to degenerative joint disease with some contribution possibly from an infectious source but unlikely.

Discharge Date: 1/29/2007 ATTENDING: COLASAMTE , ISABELLE EVON MD PRINCIPAL ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Severe aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Ms. Mcguffee is an 81-year-old female with a known history of severe aortic stenosis and multiple medical comorbidities who had been transferred from an outside hospital to the Coronary Care Unit for congestive heart failure likely related to overwhelming aortic disease. 
She had previously declined aortic valve replacement in the year prior to her admission. 
She was also prepared for urgent aortic valve replacement and possible coronary artery bypass grafting. 
At the time of her admission , her past medical history included hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , history of stroke with left upper extremity sensory loss , diabetes type 2 , hypothyroidism , hypercholesterolemia , renal failure with bilateral renal artery stenosis , parkinsonianism , iron-deficiency anemia , vitamin B12 deficiency , obstructive sleep apnea , seizure disorder and colon cancer status post resection in 1987. 
Her chest x-ray on 5/26/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure and appeared very fluid overloaded. 
She also had a two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting using vein to her left anterior descending and vein grafting to her D1 vessel. 
Neurologically , the patient suffered no acute complications postoperatively; however , her state of consciousness waxed and waned with her overall condition. 
After several months with no real recovery of her cardiovascular status , the family decided to withdraw care and put her on comfort measures only. 
Her renal status at baseline was poor , though she was not on dialysis.

RECORD #420
This is the third I Warho Hospital hospitalization for this 46-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by BKA on two prior occasions , admitted to the MICU with BKA , urosepsis , and a non-Q-wave MI. On presentation to the Emergency Department , the patient was confused and therefore proved to be a difficult historian , but she complained of four days of epigastric pain with radiation under her right breast. 
She also complained of abdominal pain for 4-5 days associated with nausea , but denied vomiting , diarrhea , constipation , hematochezia , or melena. 
In addition , she complained of some dysuria for the same time period , as well as subjective fevers , but denied cough , shortness of breath , or any prior history of heart disease or chest pain. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , with a history of BKA in October 1992 in the setting of E. coli sepsis of unclear source , history of BKA in October 2001 in the setting of MS Contin withdrawal. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission to the MICU: Temperature 103.7 , pulse 110 , blood pressure 125/55 , respiratory rate 34 , O2 sat 95% on 2 L. In general , she was an obese African American female who was confused , but alert and oriented x two. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , with normal S1 and S2. ABDOMEN: Obese , positive bowel sounds , soft , nondistended , positive tenderness in the left lower quadrant , with no guarding or rebound. 
mm ST depressions in leads 1 and aVL , 1 mm ST elevations in leads V1 and V2 , flattened T waves in leads 1 , aVL , V2 , and V3. SUMMARY: This is a 42-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by BKA on two prior occasions , who was admitted to the MICU with a BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI. HOSPITAL COURSE: Her hospital course by systems is as follows: 1. ENDOCRINE: As noted above , the patient presented with BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI. 
An echocardiogram was obtained to assess her left ventricular function in the context of her non-Q-wave MI , which was notable for normal left ventricular function , with an EF of 50% , hypokinesis of the inferior septum , a right ventricle that was mildly enlarged , with mildly decreased systolic function , normal aortic valve , mild TR , and mild MR , and a pulmonary artery pressure of 39 mm of mercury plus right atrial pressure consistent with pulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion. 
With her body habitus putting her at risk for DVT and PE , an echocardiogram which showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension raised the concern for PE being responsible for her symptoms of tachypnea and tachycardia. 
It was felt that the patient likely had obstructive sleep apnea secondary to her body habitus. 
She was maintained on CPAP during her hospitalization stay; however , the patient informed the treating team that she would not be using a CPAP machine once she returned home secondary to the inconvenience and discomfort. 
She was initially placed on aspirin , heparin , and a beta blocker. 
Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up for a goal systolic blood pressure of &lt;140 and a pulse of &lt;70. 
The Cardiology Service did not feel that the degree of this lesion warranted catheterization , given the sizable risk of catheterization in her. 
She was felt to have acute renal failure , secondary dehydration , in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis. 
Prior to discharge , the patient was counseled by the Nutrition Service regarding an appropriate diabetic and coronary artery disease diet. 
On this hospitalization , these medications were discontinued and she was placed on Neurontin for likely diabetic neuropathy. 
x 3 p.r.n. chest pain , multivitamin one tab p.o. q.d. , simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d. , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x 5 days , Toprol XL 400 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. 
DISPOSITION: Prior to discharge , the patient was evaluated by the physical therapist , who noted her to walk around the hospital Poncepor Ro without significant problems. 
Patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9 , with VNA , who will monitor her blood pressure , pulse , and blood sugar , and contact her PCP with any concerns or questions.

RECORD #421
OTHER DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Post-MI pericarditis , mural thrombus , type II diabetes mellitus , colonoscopy with colon polypectomy in 1991 , hypercholesterolemia , status post umbilical hernia repair , and questionable hypertension. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Tortorella is 72-year-old female with a history of hypercholesterolemia , type II diabetes mellitus , past smoking , and questionable hypertension , but no known cardiac disease , who presented to this hospital with vague epigastric pain/chest pain exacerbated by deep inspiration and on lying flat. 
Right heart catheterization revealed RA of 12 , RV 36/7 , PA 38/18 , and no step-up in oxygenation in the right heart. 
An echocardiogram obtained after the percutaneous coronary intervention showed an LVEF of 35%. 
We did not increase it further because of her low ejection fraction she was unlikely to tolerate such high doses. 
Rhythm wise , there has been no arrhythmia noted on telemetry on which she has been throughout her hospital stay. 
Endocrine wise , she was treated for her diabetes with an insulin regimen that consists of Lantus and Regular Insulin. 
The distal or the free wall is also hypokinetic raising the possibility of right ventricular involvement from the myocardia l infarction. 
There is no right ventricular or right atrial collapse or compression. 
Renal wise , she had no issues.

On Sunday , the patient developed nausea and vomiting , no blood or mucus in the vomit. 
He has had dry heaves for 24 hours , no diarrhea. 
Bowel movement five times per day , no fevers. 
He used to be able to walk without dyspnea on exertion , now , after several blocks , he gets short of breath. 
Positive PND , no edema , no chest pain. 
Via Dr. Nolan , abdominal pain is a sign of the patient's congestive heart failure. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever , no diarrhea , no chest pain , no palpitations , no urinary symptoms. 
He is a former IV drug abuser , smokes marijuana daily , no ethanol use , on Disability. 
HEENT showed no jaundice. 
Neck with JVP 13 cm , positive hepatojugular reflux , no bruits. 
Extremities showed no edema , well perfused. 
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 123 , positive PVCs , left axis deviation , nonspecific T wave inversion AVL , V5 , V6. Chest x-ray showed a very dilated heart , prominent hila , increased PVR , no effusions. 
Patient with known cardiomyopathy , may have had worsening of function with recent viral upper respiratory infection. 
Also may have gastritis or pancreatitis. 
Right upper quadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure. 
It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and recommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of keeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. 
JVP was now not visible. 
There was no edema.

He also has a history of dietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to heart failure exacerbations. 
Currently , he states that he has been eating "salty foods , " and has been drinking a lot of extra fluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking his medications. 
Because of these symptoms consistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians suggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of his decompensated heart failure. 
His extremities were warm without edema. 
However , he did not respond well enough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with Zaroxolyn p.r.n. 
He continued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of discharge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative , which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. 
They did not comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. 
However , he is a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS complex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good heart failure regimen up until this point. 
He has been again urged to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he is a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he is not listed given the aforementioned reasons. 
He no longer has orthopnea. 
He is able to exert himself much more without symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and he is eager to go home eScription document: 1-4309936 EMSSten Tel Dictated By: WINZER , ELFRIEDA Attending: HAUB , PERRY Dictation ID 2684934 D: 6/19/04 T: 6/19/04

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: Hypertension and diabetes. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain. 
The patient denies any associated shortness of breath , but he did note diaphoresis. 
The patient reports no chest pain since his last non-ST elevation MI in 2001. 
Of note , the patient is a very poor historian and has no recollection of past medical history or medications. 
The patient denies any drug use. 
In general , the patient was awake , alert , and in no acute distress , but answered the questions slowly and had an unusual affect. 
Neck: JVP less than 10 cm , supple , no lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiovascular exam revealed normal S1 , S2 with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. 
Extremities were warm and well perfused without edema. 
Chest x-ray had no infiltrates , no effusions. 
It was thought unlikely that the patient had flow-limiting coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient's chest pain was concerning for flow-limiting coronary artery disease. 
The patient was started on a beta-blocker and given 80 mg of Lipitor. 
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on the day of admission , which showed a right dominant system with no significant left main lesions. 
As the patient was found to have three-vessel disease and a history of diabetes , surgical revascularization was considered. 
Therefore , the patient underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization. 
The OM2 lesion was also stented with a Cypher stent across the non-diseased ostium of OM1 and then the proximal left circumflex lesion was also stented with a Cypher stent. 
The final angiograms during this catheterization showed no residual stenosis or dissection. 
The plan was for the patient to return on an outpatient basis for potential percutaneous intervention to the PDA/PLV and a stenting of the left renal artery which was found to be stenotic and likely contributing to the patient's refractory hypertension and chronic kidney disease. 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Self in the next few weeks for possible repeat percutaneous intervention. 
The patient has a long history of refractory hypertension. 
The patient's hypertension was likely exacerbated by a left renal artery stenosis found on his cardiac catheterization. 
Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry during this admission and had no issues. 
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , which was controlled with both insulin and oral agents.

He denied any nausea , pain , or radiation of his symptoms. 
The paramedics were called and the patient was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 70 to 80 percent on room air. 
He was treated with intravenous Lasix for presumed congestive heart failure and hypertension , and was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit. 
He was started on metoprolol , digoxin , lisinopril , and a heparin drip. 
He remained pain-free throughout his hospitalization , and had no further episodes of dyspnea. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of renal carcinoma status post nephrectomy in 1994. 
2. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
3. Mild hypercholesterolemia which is not currently being treated. 
4. Renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy with a baseline creatinine of 2.0. 
4. Lisinopril. 5. Furosemide. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denies any drug use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , overweight man in no acute distress. 
Neck examination was supple with his jugular venous pressure at approximately 8.0 centimeters. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
Chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally , with no rales. 
Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with a non-displaced PMI and a positive S3. 
There was no murmur. 
Abdominal examination showed an obese , soft abdomen with positive bowel sounds. 
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. 
The extremities were warm with no edema. 
His right lower extremity had a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse with a nonpalpable posterior tibial pulse. 
Liver function tests were within normal limits with an alkaline phosphatase of 95 , total bilirubin of 0.4 , and AST of 39. CPKs were 151 , 163 , and 163 with no MB fractions done. 
His triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol was elevated at 265 with an HDL fraction of 32 and an LDL fraction of 172. 
He had T wave inversions in V2 through V4 , and flat T waves in V5 through V6. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Myocardial Infarction: He was continued on a heparin drip , Lopressor , and lisinopril. 
His elevated cholesterol was treated. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1998 which showed 50 percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid left anterior descending. 
Options were considered including coronary artery bypass grafting and angioplasty. 
On July , 1998 , the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residual blockage. 
2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma for which he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. 
He also has chronic renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. 
As surgery was being considered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation was obtained to evaluate his renal status. 
This was very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. 
He then underwent an MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney which was most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. 
This was reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. three times per day.

She was tolerating the chemotherapy without complications until developing symptoms of fatigue as well as shortness of breath over a three to four day period prior to admission. 
The patient was being restaged and was found to develop acute shortness of breath over the weekend , denying any chest pain , nausea or vomiting , or light-headedness. 
The patient denies any changes in her activities except for becoming more tired with exertion and wakening up suddenly the night prior to admission feeling short of breath. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , Hodgkin's disease , hypertension , and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
Chest examination revealed bilateral lower lobe rales , no rhonchi or wheezes were appreciated. 
There is no edema at the lower extremities. 
Given the acute onset of shortness of breath and dyspnea upon exertion , causes contributing to the change in pulmonary status included pulmonary embolism , congestive heart failure , and pneumonia. 
This was markedly different from the patient's echocardiogram in January 1997 with revealed an ejection fraction of 67% with normal left ventricular function and no wall motion abnormalities. 
A repeat echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate the pericardial effusion as well as an abnormality identified on the May , 1997 , echocardiogram consistent with a possible rupture of one of the chordae tendineae. 
Initially , the addition of ionatrope was considered. 
The patient was also evaluated for the possibility of developing a pulmonary embolus. 
Lower extremity noninvasive examinations revealed patent vasculature , but no indication of a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. 
The patient was discharged on a regimen of enalapril as well as Lasix in order to manage the congestive heart failure. 
The etiology of the congestive heart failure was thought to the Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. 
Of note , the patient was noted not to be compliant with a low-salt diet. 
Three days before admission , the patient admitted to having a Chinese food dinner which may have contributed to the patient's element of congestive heart failure.

Status post cholecystectomy. 
Status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve replacement. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male with coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1982 , also status post Bjork-Shiley aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo CABG in 1995 with SVG to OM2 and SVG to LAD , who presented to Stowna Medical Center after developing chest pain unrefractory to nitroglycerin. 
He was medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor , beta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. 
Per his wife , he had been doing well since April of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens on occasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch with his son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , but this time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. He called EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following code status mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest. 
He was given normal saline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and he was paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patient would likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspected myocardial infarction. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post CABG as noted above; history of multiple non-Q-wave MIs in 1985 and subsequently history of diabetes type 2 , peripheral vascular disease , depression , chronic renal insufficiency , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , history of GI bleed , peptic ulcer disease , obstructive sleep apnea , atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , status post cholecystectomy , status post aortobifem bypass graft in 1987 , history of transfusion reaction resulting in hemolysis. 
ALLERGIES: He has no known medical allergies. 
Also with inferior T-wave inversions and 1-mm ST elevation in V3 and 1-mm ST depressions in I and O. Echocardiogram previously on 3/3 revealed an EF of 39% with inferior HK and AK , lateral HK , inferoapical DK. He had mild MR and aortic radiant of 27/16. 
In summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chronic coronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in the setting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated ST elevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Pagham University Of .  
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferred emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where catheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graft disease. 
The distal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease and the distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseased with focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. 
In summary , the patient had what was considered to be a nonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted for medical management. 
He received optimal medical management for his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix , statin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. 
The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine and Neo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out to the floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. 
However , after the patient had been transferred to the floor and was stable , he received a single lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy , coronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest. 
Infectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question of sepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . 
He was started on empiric levofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia by chest x-ray. 
He ultimately had no growth from any blood cultures , although did have on sputum culture positive for pseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant to levofloxacin. 
Endocrine: The patient with diabetes. 
However , would not convert to atenolol given the renal insufficiency.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease , status post remote IMI ( catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes , hypercholesteremia , hypertension , admitted on 5/1/2005 for chest pain. 
She had associated diaphoresis and nausea but no shortness of breath. 
She was subsequently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab , then transferred to the CCU for further management. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CVA ( remote ) , CAD ( status post remote IMI; catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesteremia , hypertension , diverticulosis , spinal stenosis , disk disease , osteoarthritis , status post total knee replacement , positive PPD in the past. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On 5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the left circumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosis of the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. 
On 1/23/2005 , the patient was taken back to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea of precluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block. 
The patient was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. 
A stat echo performed in the cardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle. 
In the cardiac catheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. 
On 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. 
She was without chest pain or shortness of breath for the duration of her hospital stay. 
She had not been on a statin previously. 
On the day of discharge , she was able to ambulate on room air without desaturating. 
This drop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematoma status post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequently stabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). 
A urine culture from 8/3/2005 showed no growth. 
Blood cultures were not rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile without signs of bacteremia.

RECORD #450
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old African- American gentleman with a complicated medical history including severe alcoholism and coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure who has at baseline had shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and at times paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea also orthopnea. 
The patient presented four days prior to admission on 10 of February to his primary care physician Dr. Homby with a cough chills , but no fever , myalgias , pleuritic chest pain and weight loss of 9 lb , from 167 to 158 in three months with increased paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
The patient had not been taking his congestive heart failure/cardiac medications for at least one week. 
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia but was suggestive congestive heart failure. 
His congestive heart failure medications were refilled. 
The patient was not getting antibiotics. 
The patient developed progressive malaise , anorexia , was unable to get out of bed , poor p.o. He denied any increased alcohol abuse at that time. 
There was no abdominal pain per the patient's girlfriend but there were complaints that the patient's mental status was worsening. 
serum glucose was negative at 1800 with an anion gap of 27 , serum sodium 129 , serum potassium 7.6 , BUN 178 and a creatinine 7.5. 
Also of note , the patient has a history of severe alcoholism , denies any preadmission alcohol binges at that time; but , later admitted to drinking of one to two gallons of gin and vodka at a time with his friends and also drinking many beers. 
There was no jugular venous distention and low lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiovascular - Regular rate and rhythm with positive ectopy , no murmur , regurg or gallop. 
His abdomen was soft , diffusely tender , mildly distended with positive bowel sounds with no liver edge palpated. 
His skin had no petechiae , no rash and no splinters. 
Digoxin level was 0.8 , tox screen was negative. 
EKG showed ventricular pacing at a rate of 77. Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrates or effusions. 
An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that the patient was likely not in DKA as the patient's level of betahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain the patient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. 
A renal ultrasound performed on 1 of July showed no evidence of gallstones or biliary duct dilatation. 
An abdominal CT performed on 7 of July showed grade I pancreatitis with no evidence of a pseudocyst. 
The patient's clinical course was complicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to a hypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as the patient's CKs began to rise while the patient's phosphate was still secondary to the acute renal failure. 
However , in the night of 20 of June the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was a question of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratory laparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. 
However , the findings were not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severe pancreatitis was noted. 
There was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. 
Also noted was some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of obstruction. 
The patient has tolerated this well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal pain either subjectively or on exam. 
If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer be swabbed and sent for HSV. 2. ENDOCRINE: I. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient's pancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic. 
The patient also has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three weeks as noted below. 
3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout his stay here. 
This has not limited him in any way. 
4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usually ranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonary problems. 
He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt to be due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is taking Lasix. 
Also of note the patient has been heme negative from below for more than ten days. 
While here he was also presumptively treated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on his stool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. 
As noted when the patient is switched over to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendations that NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with an insulin sliding scale at bedtime. 
The patient today denies any abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mild back pain. 
His extremities are without edema. 
OPERATIONS DURING ADMISSION: Exploratory laparotomy performed on 20 of June without complications.

RECORD #453
Discharge Date: 1/18/2003 CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 72-year-old man with a history of significant coronary artery disease , status post CABG x 2 , stents and brachytherapy who was admitted for an NSVT leading to fatigue and shortness of breath. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient's symptoms first developed last September , 2002 when he noticed fatigue and shortness of breath. 
He was being treated with atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. at the time for his coronary artery disease. 
Over the past few months the patient has also noticed increased angina , both with and without activity. 
Then two days prior to admission the patient also noticed pain at rest but was again relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. 
He did not take any nitroglycerin but his wife told him that he was "gasping for breath". 
Because of his shortness of breath he was started on Lasix for 3-4 days but this also did not relieve his symptoms. 
He had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1974 and 1982. 
The patient has remained on aspirin and Plavix secondary to his coronary artery disease. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former engineer for Oregon , but stopped working when he was in his 40s because of his coronary artery disease. 
He denies any tobacco , alcohol , or drug use. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Two-pillow orthopnea that is stable , no palpitations. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: Ischemia: It was unclear whether the patient's worsening chest pain was from progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this was demand ischemia from his frequent NSVT. 
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of his arrhythmia , he was taken for catheterization. 
It was determined to further treat the patient's coronary artery disease with medical management. 
He did not have any EKG changes during the procedure. 
He was actually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain or shortness of breath. 
It is possible that the symptoms that he had later on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overload which responded well to diuresis. 
He had an ICD and DDI pacemaker placed on 7/26 without complication. 
After the pacemaker was placed he was still experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may have been overpaced. 
4 ) Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes. 
Given his history of radiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that he had this. 
He always remained hemodynamically stable and did not require any transfusions.

The patient was noted to have markedly elevated troponin and progressive T-wave inversions laterally. 
1. Cardiovascular ischemia , following admission , the patient was initiated on aspirin , Plavix , nitroglycerin drip , oxygen p.r.n. , and the beta-blocker was titrated up as tolerated. 
Over the first night of admission , the patient noted increasing chest discomfort. 
The patient did not have chest pain on the night of admission , however was noted to have EKG changes and elevated troponin as mentioned. 
On the morning following admission , on 11/8/05 , the patient was noted to have new onset of chest discomfort and at that time was noted to have ST elevations in her inferior leads III and F as well as V6 and L.

She had had mild elevations in her LFTs , most notably an alk phos of 293. 
An abdominal CT was obtained without contrast that showed no sign of obstruction , hepatobiliary disease , but was notable for a ventral hernia that was not strangulated or incarcerated. 
7. Heme , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop prior to cath. 
There was no acute source of blood loss noted. 
The patient's hematocrit continued to trend down and on 7/16/05 , an abdominal CT was obtained to rule out retroperitoneal bleed , which was negative. 
8. FEN , the patient was not given any electrolyte scales secondary to her acute renal insufficiency. 
She was noted to have hyponatremia with a lowest of 123 and was therefore placed on free water 1.5-liter restriction with adequate resolution.

Of note she was ruled out for active pulmonary tuberculosis during her admission in P Therford Hospital in September 1992. 
Her vital signs reveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular , respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with no orthostatic hypertension. 
Head and neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence of adenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. 
Respiratory system showed scattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. 
There was no evidence of paradoxical alternates. 
Bowel sounds were present , and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. 
Rectal examination showed no masses , guaiac negative brown stool. 
There was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated. 
Chest X ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of both left and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. 
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minute with a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acute ischemia. 
There was no change as compared with electrocardiograms from 2/10 .  
The initial CPK was 44. HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary then the patient is a 54-year-old woman with cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependent diabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain and dyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation. 
Actively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) Cardiomegaly of unclear etiology: last echo done was in 25 of November by Dr. Kush which showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and right ventricular dilatation. 2 ) Chest pressure and substernal chest pain and dyspnea: The patient was placed on the telemetry floor , was monitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. 
The CK were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence of electrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. 
3 ) Noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet and Glucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughout this admission. 
4 ) Status post tuberculosis: In view of her previous tuberculosis status , a PPD was not performed and the patient was not ruled out for tuberculosis. 
On review of Mrs. Dimalanta 's history and following a rule out for a recent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercise tolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three months and that she was already on optimal medications. 
A transthoracic echocardiogram performed on 2 of May showed once again a dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. 
However , in view of the dilated cardiomyopathy , the patient was started on Coumadin therapy. 
She experienced on chest pain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. 
The following tests were sent off , the results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) One chest X ray detailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis and sediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) SMA-7 with CPK , complete with differential , PT , PTT , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocyte count and bleeding time; 5 ) HLA typing and antibody screen which are pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapy consult; 9 ) Social Service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 ) Gynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking for bilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests were performed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid Doppler studies and peripheral arterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of which are pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercise test with O2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinine and protein; 17 ) HIV antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serum protein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides , immunoglobulins , hepatitis B and C serology , as well as blood cultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 ) psychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and will be done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus , Ebstein-Barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent; 21 ) TFT and hemoglobin A1C were sent; and 22 ) right heart catheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were done and were within normal limits.

She was prescribed Provera and oral contraceptive pills without relief. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , not well controlled. 
She is a recovered cocaine abuser , stating she has not used in six months. 
She continued to have temperatures without good ambulation. 
The patient's affect suggested some secondary game for delaying discharge from hospital. 
She was eating well , eating French toast and eggs on the day of discharge without problems.

RECORD #459
ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY: NEURO: Neurology consult was obtained for increased somnolence over the past three weeks , which was noted per the patient's son which he thinks is a change from baseline. 
Neurology consult recommended that we get an MRI/MRA of the brain with gadolinium contrast to look for leptomeningeal disease and other sources for increased somnolence which are treatable. 
The EEG was done and showed no seizure activity. 
The MRI/MRA was done and showed only a right MCA infarct , which was known and old with no interval change. 
Gadolinium contrast was not given because the patient became too agitated and was moving too much during the study for an effective study to be obtained. 
They also recommended that we check certain labs including folate , B12 , TSH and RPR all of which were essentially normal. 
Neurology was consulted on the day of discharge and they agreed that no further evaluation of the somnolence is necessary at this time. 
If the somnolence continues into the near future further evaluation may be necessary. 
Leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given the lack of new neurological findings , and since the patient is scheduled for a PET scan of the chest to evaluate for spread of her known lung cancer , if there is no interval change in her oncological process the likeliness of leptomeningeal disease is quite low. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , vitamin B12 1000 mcg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. daily , Niferex-150 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Senna two tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly , Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily , Lamictal 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nexium 20 mg p.o. daily , Lidoderm 5% patch topically daily , NovoLog sliding scale , Cymbalta 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily. 
Her heart rate , respirations and oxygen saturations were all normal. 
At discharge , Ms. Telander 's mental status remained at baseline and she showed no signs of agitation at the time of my exam.

She was afebrile without symptoms until day nine of ATGAM when a rash became apparent starting on her right forearm with a rectangular red erythematous maculopapular patch which later extended over her entire body and it was pruritic. 
This may have been partly secondary either to her ATGAM being turned up on the night of 6 of March by the patient by accident or also may have been due to Ceftaz and Vanco which was started on 6 of March for a febrile episode on the eighth day of ATGAM. 
The patient was treated with Ceftaz and Vanc for possible otitis. 
This was later changed to Augmentin when rash was thought to be possibly secondary to Ceftaz and then this again was changed later to po Cipro when she was no longer neutropenic and her symptoms appeared to be resolving. 
During the episode of the rash her urine also changed to a dark coke-colored urine which contained red blood cells , no casts were noted , however , it was felt to be consistent with serum sickness and so the patient was changed from the 40 mg prednisone started for the ATGAM so that she would be afebrile and to minimize reaction of the ATGAM to IV Solu Medrol. 
She tolerated the packed red blood cell transfusion well , however , in general she noted her usual reaction to platelets with rigors and chills and was given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV at the same time. 
Also while using Solu Medrol one night prior to admission she was given one bag of platelets for which she developed a little bit of an increased rash which faded rapidly on stopping the platelets and a platelet blood transfusion reaction workup was done.

CT of the chest on 2/10 revealed consolidation improved since admission , no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and low attenuation areas of enlargement within both adrenal glands , unchanged from the admission CT. 
An abdominal CT showed calcified gallstone , a left apical adrenal nodule needing further imaging and a tiny , hypoattenuating liver lesion in the right liver lobe. 
Because of the finding in the adrenal glands , an MRI of the abdomen without contrast was also completed on the day prior to discharge. 
It was decided that if there was no evidence of metastatic disease , the patient would possibly be offered left upper lobectomy for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. 
If there were evidence of metastatic disease on biopsy of a visible adrenal nodule , then potential medical therapy would include chemotherapy and radiation. 
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia; however , chest PA and lateral was negative. 
He was loaded with IV amiodarone and subsequently returned to normal sinus rhythm. 
He was on maintenance dose of 200 mg p.o. q. d. and remained in normal sinus rhythm.

RECORD #512
The patient has an extensive psychiatric history and an apparent history of tuberculosis treated in 1987 for one year ( confirmation of this fact is not found at the present time ). 
The patient notes that he has had blood tinged sputum and occasional bright red blood for the past five days totalling about 1/8th of a cup a day. 
He denies any fevers , chills or other sputum production , but he notes a positive cough. 
He has had no tuberculosis follow-up since 1988. 
He notes no weakness in his lower extremities , no incontinence. 
The patient has noted an extensive psychiatric history , evidently followed by Dr. Brannigan at the Mi Cotco Wayne Stead Health Services at the Rons County Memorial Hospital ( number 731-9804. 
) The patient was apparently diagnosed with paranoid schizoid disorder vs. bipolar vs. schizophrenia. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Tuberculosis , status post treatment possibly for one year in 1987 , though no confirmation of this has been found. 
3 ) Status post cholecystectomy. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
There was no scleral icterus. 
Neck was supple without any adenopathy , no jugular venous pressure was noted. 
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a two out of six holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex , no S3 or S4. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
Abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , positive bowel sounds. 
Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema noted. 
On admission , the patient received a chest x-ray which showed a possible ground glass infiltrate in the right medial segment of the upper lung field approximately 1 cm in size , otherwise clear lung fields. 
LABORATORY: The patient's laboratory examinations on admission were all within normal limits. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out tuberculosis and was subsequently kept in the respiratory isolation room and serial induced sputums were sent for culture and stain and noted to be negative for acid fast bacilli or other signs of tuberculosis. 
The patient was also noted to have no further signs of hemoptysis while he was in the hospital and therefore his history of hemoptysis has not been verified. 
The patient was very cooperative while in the hospital and showed no signs of being febrile or other signs of active infection. 
It also did not appear that the patient had any form of possible lung malignancy because he did not report weight loss or other suggestive features To further work-up this up however , the patient received a spiral CT scan of his chest which showed no focal abnormalities and was notable for clear lung fields and no signs of tuberculosis. 
As this was the case , the patient was subsequently discharged home having been ruled out for tuberculosis. 
Notable also , his PPD was negative at 48 hours with a positive mumps and Candida anergy panel also suggestive of not having tuberculosis. 
The patient was continued on his medications and noted to be quite stable while he was in the hospital. 
He was deemed not medically able to make his own decisions on admission and was therefore not allowed to leave when the patient tried to leave on the night of admission. 
The patient was subsequently discharged on July , 1997 in good condition with the name and addresses of possible places to stay and close follow-up with a social worker and his psychiatrist. 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Cogentin 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 ) Depakote 100 mg p.o. q. AM , 200 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3 ) Prolixin. 4 ) Tylenol p.r.n. back pain.

Previous anginal chest pain per pt. was chest tightness , but given her history of CAD her epigastric pain has been investigated for an ischemic cause. 
The patient underwent PET CT 2 months prior that revealed an LvEF of 70% , no wall motion abnormalities , and inferiolateral and basal anterolateral wall ischemia ( reversible at rest ) , in the distribution of the LCx. 
She was sent as a direct admit for evaluation of ischemia and possible catheterization.

Additionally , a TAXUS stent was applied to an 80% ostial occlusion of the OM1 with no residual occlusion. 
RCA disease was present with proximal 40% and ostial 50% occlusions that required no intervention. 
The patient was asymptomatic during this event , and has not had any complications.

RECORD #519
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old woman with coronary risk factors of diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , age , and elevated cholesterol , who was admitted to the Cardiology Service after a syncope in vascular clinic. 
The patient did not recall an aura or a prodrome. 
She denied any incontinence and aura or postictal confusion. 
The patient has no known drug allergies. 
She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. 
She had no jugular venous distention. 
There was a question of soft bilateral carotid bruits. 
The abdomen was soft , without hepatosplenomegaly. 
In the extremities , there are incisional scars at the medial calves on both legs , with 1+ DP pulses bilaterally , her legs were warm , and there was no edema. 
On neuro exam , she was alert and oriented x 3 , cranial nerves III-XII were grossly normal , and her motor exam was without focal deficits. 
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , with left axis deviation , evidence of LVH , left atrial enlargement , and some T wave flattening in V4 through 6 and T wave inversion in 1 and L. Her chest x-ray was without infiltrate or pulmonary arterial congestion. 
In summary , this is a 65-year-old woman with vasculopathy and extensive coronary artery disease , who presented with sudden syncope x 1-2 minutes. 
Her hospital course is summarized by systems: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient was placed on the monitor and no definitye symptomatic arrhythmias were observed. 
She had a cardiac catheterization on 1/9/2002 , which revealed an 80% proximal circumflex lesion which was stented to 0%. 
2. PULMONARY: One of the considerations entertained to explain the patient's syncope was a potential pulmonary embolus. 
Though she had not been hypoxic on presentation , the sudden nature of the event , as well as her tachycardia , was felt to warrant further workup for a PE. 
Lower extremity noninvasive ultrasounds of both legs revealed no thrombus. 
3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Given her neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of her cervical spine performed , which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. 
She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at the recommendation of the Medical Consult Service. 
On the morning of hospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under the recommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt to likely add little benefit. 
She was ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2 where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacement with irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibiotic spacer. 
She was ultimately extubated mid morning on postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that time and the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. 
She was continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR was still not therapeutic.

There was no obvious evidence of infection , however , it is certainly possible that there is a soft tissue surrounding that ulcer. 
The patient had tibial and fibula films which at first there was some consideration of whether there was abnormality to the bone. 
On further consideration , it was felt this is most likely not the case , however , to evaluate more specifically a bone scan was performed. 
There was no uptake in the area of that ulcer , however , there was some mild uptake at the left Achilles tendon calcaneal insertion and marked uptake in the T9 thoracic 9th vertebrae. 
A CAT scan of the spine was performed which revealed no evidence of infection or neoplasm but there was evidence of osteopenia and possibly a microfracture but no evidence of real compression fracture. 
The recommendation for three times a day wet-to-dry dressings without additional ointments or treatments. 
In the past she has had multiple other multiple drug resistant organisms that grew from her sputum cultures at other institutions and it was felt that unless she demonstrated evidence of clinical pulmonary infection these should not be treated. 
However , on repeat cuff pressure manually it was revealed that her blood pressure actually was normal and that there was dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of the automatic cuff , therefore it was thought that this low blood pressure was spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff that was being used. 
3. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. 
At this point , she will be discharged on that low dose of beta-blocker. 
This was actually discontinued after a couple of days in anticipation of a possible procedure. 
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes. 
Her diabetes was controlled with insulin NPH 35 units subcutaneous every morning with a regular insulin sliding scale every 6 hours as well. 
She was not able to tolerate these for a long period of time , however , it does seem that she has improved to some degree in terms of her ventilatory mechanics. 
The hemodialysis service should be aware and consider replacement as indicated. 
At this point there is no indication of infection of either of those lines , however , she is at high risk of infection of both. 
Please feel free to contact Dr. Mohamed B Bilsborough , the patient's ICU physician here at Pagham University Of with any questions you may have. 
4. Heparin intravenous 1050 units per hour , this will be adjusted based on her PTT from this morning which is not yet available. 
22. Papain and urea topical three times a day , to only be used for those heels if Panafil spray not available.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old male with hypotension , diabetes , and obesity. 
An echo showed a normal EF and no evidence of thrombosis. 
There was no evidence of a-fib. 
The patient also developed a UTI by UA , but not a positive culture data. 
The patient then became increasingly sedated and developed an O2 requirement , and was eventually on lung non-rebreather. 
It was 7.33/56/113 on 100% non-rebreather. 
The patient's echo was also normal the week before and there were no signs of systolic dysfunction. 
The patient was continued on aspirin and statin and , after the ICU stay , the patient was transferred back to the floor and the patient's cardiovascular was stable and the patient's antihypertensive regimen was resumed. 
Pulmonary: The patient has weaned off the non-rebreather after the stay from ICU and has been satting well between 96-97% on 3-4 liters. 
Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin and ceftazidime in the setting of hypotension and concern for possible sepsis at the beginning. 
However , due to no growth to date with the blood cultures , the infectious etiology of hypotension is unlikely. 
As a result , antibiotics were not continued when the patient was transferred back to the floor. 
Under the evaluation by the urologist , the patient does not need chronic bladder irrigation anymore. 
The urologist suggested that the bladder has actually stopped bleeding with clear urine drained. 
However , the bleeding stopped very quickly and the urologist placed a second Foley into the bladder without any complications. 
In their opinion , the patient does not have any urological symptoms , and the patient should have the Foley for the following 4-5 weeks. 
Per Urology , the patient may not be able to control his bladder due to the stroke that the patient had the week before , so the patient will need chronic Foley for the next 4-5 weeks until followup with the urologist in the office. 
Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes and continued to have NPH and subcutaneous heparin. 
We did not resume the patient's home regimen of Lasix and patient's discharge medication will continue to be Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.

His cardiac risk factors include hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use , family history. 
He does not have diabetes mellitus , although he has had chemical diabetes mellitus in the past while on steroids. 
He is transferred from Darnla Nashris Doweeksbar County Memorial Hospital with questionable chest pain during the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bronchitis flare. 
In 10 of January he had an asthma flare. 
He had 1 mm ST depression in 2 , 3 and F. He reached maximum heart rate of 137 , blood pressure 186/80. 
Since that time he has had multiple , multiple admissions for asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares and rule out for myocardial infarction; each time ruling out. 
He did not have any chest pain , ectopy or evidence of ischemia on EKG , although there was questionable old infarct or ischemia at the apex on the thallium images. 
He refused cardiac catheterization at that time and was felt to be not competent to do such. 
He continued to refuse cardiac catheterization. 
He had 0.5 mm ST depressions in V4 through V6. 
He was slightly labored breathing on admission , but was not in respiratory distress. 
There was no murmurs , gallops or rubs. 
He did not have any rashes. 
He had inverted Ts in 1 and L and nonspecific T-wave changes throughout with some 0.5 mm ST depressions at baseline in his inferior leads. 
He was admitted and declined catheterization initially , asking about an exercise test first. 
He underwent an exercise echocardiogram on 11 of August which showed one mm ST depression on top of the half mm baseline ST depressions of the inferior leads , potentially consistent with ischemia although when the echo images were reviewed they were not thought to be consistent with ischemia. 
There was no change in wall motion during exercise as compared to rest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Flow is an 83-year-old woman with multiple medical problems including CAD status post CABG , diabetes mellitus , CHF ( EF 55% ) and atrial fibrillation who presented with hypotension , likely secondary to sepsis from right lower extremity cellulitis. 
She was started on dopamine , Levophed and vasopressin as well as Decadron. 
Surgery was consulted for biopsy as to rule out the possibility of necrotizing fascitis. 
She had no hypertension or WBC casts. 
She had low complement levels , so there was some question of HUS after group B strep infection , although there were no schistocytes on her smear. 
In terms of her hypertension , her blood pressure has normalized and her beta-blocker is being titrated upwards. 
There was no clear precipitant other than sepsis. 
She has a normocytic anemia with a large drop in hematocrit since admission and there was some concern for hemolysis with the rising bilirubin , low haptoglobin with multiple immature erythrocytes , but no schistocytes were seen on manual diff. 
The appearance of the fluid was consistent with gout. 
She was started on Decadron 4 mg p.o. q.6h. 
Her hepatitis serologies are negative and Tylenol has been held since 8/27/06 . 
From a dermatologic standpoint , she has had left lower extremity venostasis ulcers. 
She does not have pneumo boots on because of cellulitis and heparin was held with thrombocytopenia , now will be restarted on 10/27/07 or when her INR is 1.5 rather. 
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.7 , gout , osteoarthritis , status post left total knee replacement in 1995 , status post right total knee replacement in 1990 , hypothyroid , osteoporosis , and chronic hearing loss. 
Question for quinolones , unknown reaction , but the patient have been taking levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the past without a problem. 
She has a son with a history of diabetes. 
She had baseline osteoarthritis in the shoulders , right greater than left. 
Chest x-ray on 8/7/06 showed cardiomegaly , a right IJ in place ( placed in the ED ) , no focal consolidation. 
CT of the right lower extremity showed cellulitis without gas. 
Echo in July 2004 , EF of 55% , no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
Blood cultures on 11/22/06 positive for beta hemolytic group A strep. Blood cultures 3/9/06 , no growth. 
Joint fluid on 6/7/06 from the right knee , no growth , rare polys , no organisms seen on Gram stain. 
Blood cultures from 1/4/06 , 12 , and 11/6/06 , all no growth to date at the time of this dictation. 
Right lower extremity fascial biopsy on 8/7/06 , dense fibroconnective tissue , no acute inflammation present. 
Second echo was pending on 10/27/07 at the time of this dictation to rule out any kind of vegetation. 
The patient may have a permanent tunneled catheter placed depending on how her urine output recovers. 
She will continue her aspirin and beta-blocker. 
The patient now has normal blood pressure with titrating her beta-blocker up and considering adding a second agent to normalize her hypotension. 
4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus. 
Her home regimen is Lantus. the tube feeds were discontinued on 10/27/07 as the patient was cleared to eat a diabetic diet and we will transition her insulin accordingly. 
She is hypothyroid and we should continue her home Levoxyl. 5. Rheumatology: The patient had a gout flare in her left hand , right shoulder , and right knee. 
Taps were consistent with gout. 
The cultures were no growth to date. 
It could be possible that the changes in her hematocrit and platelets are due to sepsis. 
8. Neurology: The patient has severe pain from gout. 
She is on a Dilaudid PCA initially , now is on her home fentanyl patch with Dilaudid boluses p.r.n. 9. Dermatology: The patient has a history of venostasis ulcers and right arterial lower extremity insufficiency. 
She could not have an MRI to study flow to those legs as she has a pacemaker. 
3. Make a decision about whether or not the patient will need intermittent hemodialysis and if so , through what access. 4. Resume Coumadin once that access has been placed or once all lines have been removed. 
6. ABIs for both legs and followup of chronic , non-healing wound.

4. Type II diabetes. 
8. Question of TIA in the past with right-sided numbness. 
This chest sensation did not radiate and was unassociated with nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis or lightheadedness. 
The patient also had cough with green sputum x1 year , no fevers or chills , no sick contacts. 
Also , noted no change in bowel/bladder habits , no change in meds and no dietary changes. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , metoprolol , allopurinol , valsartan , glipizide , Lipitor , and nifedipine. 
In general , she was in no acute distress , JVP 12 cm with positive hepatojugular reflux , soft bibasilar rales , regular rate and rhythm , 2-3/6 systolic murmur , loudest at the left upper sternal border , ( mild AS on echo from 1/26 ). 
LABORATORY DATA: Showed a sodium of 129 , potassium of 5.7 , creatinine of 2.8 with a baseline anywhere between 2 and 3.5 , cardiac enzymes negative x1 , BNP of 1448. 
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small bilateral effusions , no infiltrate. 
Continued her aspirin , beta-blockers , and statin for coronary artery disease. 
An echo showed stable aortic stenosis without any acute worsening. 
We did not restart her glipizide at the time of discharge until follow up with Dr. Goud given her overall worsening creatinine clearance. 
4. Rheumatology: History of gout , change her allopurinol to q.72h. 
She did complain of some left heel pain and left foot pain , thought secondary to her gout. 
5. Heme: Hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25 , her guaiac was negative on the 2/5/04 . 
Because of her coronary artery disease , she was transfused total of 3 units over the course of her hospital stay to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. 
An ENT evaluation showed a small area of ulceration in her posterior nasopharynx , which will need a follow up possibly with a CT as an outpatient to rule out malignancy. 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Goud in one to two weeks , which has not been scheduled , and with Dr. Younker with Nephrology which has been scheduled for 2/18/04 .

OTHER DIAGNOSES: CHF , hypertension , bronchospastic asthma , nonischemic cardiomyopathy , and pulmonary hypertension. 
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old female with hypertension , asthma with baseline PAF , peak flows of 150 to 175 , and history of previous nonischemic cardiomyopathy with most recent EF of 55% on 4/11/04 as well as pulmonary hypertension with the pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 96 mmHg , who was in her usual state of health until three or four days prior to admission when she developed cough and symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. 
She had no reported fevers or chills. 
Hypertension , asthma , tobacco use , nonischemic cardiomyopathy , and pulmonary hypertension. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Albuterol , atorvastatin , aspirin 325 mg , Flovent b.i.d. , potassium 20 mEq t.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg q.d. , magnesium oxide , multivitamins , Norvasc 10 mg q.d. , Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , and Valium. 
On transfer from the CCU , she had normal sinus rhythm with occasional signs of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , which was thought possibly due to her pulmonary process. 
In terms of her ischemia , she had some troponin leak , it was thought to be in the setting of CHF , but that was trending downward and her blood pressure was difficult to control likely due to medical noncompliance , longstanding hypertension at home. 
2. In terms o her pulmonary status , there was a question of a left infiltrate on her chest x-ray , so she was started on levofloxacin and she was continued to be treated with Solu-Medrol IV with switching to prednisone 60 mg p.o. Her ABG showed mild retention that would be expected in the setting and we continued levalbuterol nebulizers q.4h. 
and did not start a steroid taper. 
We were able to accomplish this diuresis with Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. p.o. and did not need to initiate any form of drips. 
It was at that time decided that electrical cardioversion would not be optimal in her stay , so it was decided that she would be chemically cardioverted using the drug dofetilide. 
She tolerated the chemical cardioversion and went back into mostly sinus rhythm without too much ectopy or signs of any other arrhythmia , then we were able to decrease her diltiazem down to 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. 
In terms of her cardiovascular status , a right heart cath was done on the March , 2004 , which showed the following pressures: RA pressures of 10 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressures of 12 , and pulmonary artery pressures of 60 with cardiac output of 6. Swan-Ganz catheter readings also showed similar pressure suggesting that the causes of her respiratory distress were more respiratory disease in nature as opposed to CHF heart failure nature. 
We did not begin the taper of her prednisone until after she was discharged. 
She will be arranged for followup in the Pulmonary Clinic , 337-8573 , for management of her asthma , COPD , and pulmonary hypertension. 
She had good urine output and no other major electrolyte abnormalities after her initial low sodiums. 
Her white count was somewhat high , but she was on steroids and was not thought to be infected. 
, Atrovent inhalers two puffs four times a day , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Flovent 220 mcg inhaled b.i.d. , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. , and simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.

The patient was admitted recently on January for bilateral iliac percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and received a popliteal to posterior tibial bypass with saphenous vein on the right lower extremity. 
The patient received Mylanta at Thoeaston Healthcare without any relief. 
Electrocardiogram was done at the rehab center at around 4 p.m. with no significant changes compared to her previous electrocardiograms. 
She denies any radiation of her pain. 
There was no nausea or vomiting. 
However , given her significant past medical history of coronary artery disease as well as a very recent non-Q wave myocardial infarction , patient was admitted to the General Medicine Service for rule out myocardial infarction. 
The patient has a coronary artery disease with a MIBI done in September of 1996 which was notable for inferior ischemia with 5/25 segments. 
In addition to her cardiac history and diabetes history , the patient also has a history of panic attacks. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general , patient is a irish speaking elderly woman who does understand some English and was resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress. 
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub or gallop. 
Abdomen examination reveals positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender in palpation. 
The wound appears clean with no exudates and no erythema. 
There was no edema on the left lower extremity. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medicine Service for rule out myocardial infarction. 
However , she reported that this came on after she had eaten her meal and the pain was localized to the epigastrium with no radiation. 
Her electrocardiogram at that time showed no changes. 
During this hospitalization , the patient did not have any cardiac related chest pain. 
It is very possible that her troponin level of 0.17 is just the tail end of a recent myocardial infarction and the level is on it's way down.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old female with a history of long standing hypertension and diabetes who says that she had been doing well until approximately one week prior to admission when she was in Days Ty for a wedding and during that time she was unable to follow her normal strict low salt diet. 
She went to see her doctor , Dr. Viray in Clinic the next morning who found her to be in congestive heart failure and recommended her to go to I Warho Hospital .  
Neck was supple with no carotid bruits. 
Lungs clear to auscultation without any crackles. 
Extremities were without any edema. 
Her chest x-ray showed an enlarged heart with pleural effusions and cephalization which was often shown with congestive heart failure. 
She was seen by the Cardiology Group who on further evaluation of her also felt that even with the resolution of her congestive heart failure she was ready to go home with adjustment in her blood pressure medications and felt that with her bradycardia she would not be able to tolerate her Lopressor. 
The patient then underwent pacemaker placement without any difficulty and it was interrogated the day after placement without any problem. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged in stable condition with no reportable disease and no adverse drug reactions.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco and alcohol use. 
General Appearance: Morbidly obese female , sleepy , arousable , in no acute distress. 
6. Chest x-ray: Showed no infiltrate or effusion. 
MRI in 2/17 showed no change or evidence of tumor recurrence. 
She has had no other pulmonary complications. 
The patient has no history of cardiac disease. 
An echocardiogram done on 6/1/05 showed normal LV function with preserved ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral regurgitation. 
In terms of her rhythm , the patient has a resting bradycardia in the 30s to 40s that is thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone and has no hemodynamic consequence. 
In this young woman , it was deemed that a pacemaker would not be an appropriate choice. 
She did have 3-4 second pauses on one occasion on the floor but had no recurrence throughout the rest of her stay. 
In terms of ischemia , the patient had a slightly elevated CK-MB on admission , but she has had a normal echocardiogram and negative troponin since. 
They have recommended that she not increase her home dose , instead she will aggressively increase her p.o. water intake in order to maintain her normal sodium. 
There was no indication for growth hormone replacement. 
The patient had no clear etiology for her hypersomnolence. 
She does not appear to be hypercarbic or hypoxic. 
Her infectious workup was entirely negative and she was therefore taken off antibiotics. 
Her EEG showed nonspecific diffuse slowing with no seizure foci. 
This was therefore discontinued and she should not start this once she returns home. 
This too may have been due to Provigil effect. 
Her central line was also removed on 3/9/05 without complications.

RECORD #568
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Huertes is a 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease who presents after being discharged from two recent admission to Pagham University Of 24 hours after she went to rehabilitation with fevers , diffuse body pains , and hypertension. 
An MRI was obtained at that time , which revealed no acute abnormalities. 
Transesophageal echocardiogram was also obtained at that time because of the prior positive blood culture and it was negative for vegetation or severe valve disease. 
She developed a nonproductive cough and some mild pleuritic chest pain. 
She received 2 mg of morphine approximately a liter of normal saline and some Tylenol. 
She was normocephalic and atraumatic and had surgical pupils bilaterally. 
Her neck was supple and her jugular venous pressure was 8 cm. 
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border without any radiation. 
Her abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and nondistended with good bowel sounds. 
Her extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
LABORATORY DATA: Her admission laboratory data was significant for a uremia related to her end-stage renal disease , normal LFTs , cardiac enzymes less than assay , and a white count of 17.2 up from 9.2 just two days earlier. 
Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with no effusions and some mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature. 
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm and T-wave inversions at 5 and 6 as well as 1 and AVR , which are old. 
On her very first day of admission , she became hypertensive during dialysis , but had a normal blood pressure again after receiving back the ultrafiltration fluid that had been taken off. 
Also of note during her hospital stay , given her fevers and unrevealing infectious workup , an MRI was completed with a renal protocol to evaluate this left renal cyst. 
However , it did not enhance and upon review with the radiologist it was deemed very unlikely that this cyst would represent a renal cell carcinoma. 
2. Infectious disease: Given the fact that Ms. Huertes presented with intermittent fevers all the way up to 102 , some mild hypertension associated with dialysis , and previous positive blood cultures , an infectious disease consult was called. 
After extensive infectious disease workup including blood cultures , urine cultures , abdomen CTs , as well as induced sputum , no source for infection was revealed. 
However , it was felt that Ms. Huertes may have had a viral upper respiratory tract infection and/or bronchitis which was not treated. 
She received a single dose of vancomycin and gentamicin upon admission for her hypertension and fever , but received no further antibiotics during her hospital stay. 
She was afebrile during the last seven days and had a stable white count and no left shift. 
Her abdominal CT revealed no obvious abscess and urine analysis was negative. 
A chest CT from her last admission revealed no interstitial lung disease , no significant pulmonary edema , and no infiltrative disease. 
She had a set of PSP on 3/11/2003 , which revealed a restrictive physiology , but may not have had sufficient effort. 
Of note , the patient had an echocardiogram from 9/1 , which revealed a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 59. 
It was felt that this may have been spurious as the previous echocardiogram revealed aortic pressure in the 30s. 
This means that it is unlikely that pulmonary hypertension is causing her shortness of breath. 
Overnight pulse oximetry revealed no desaturations and there is a very low probability of sleep apnea despite habitus and a low probability based on her history. 
She does not report any daytime somnolence. 
It is possible that outpatient pulmonary function test and sleep studies will be considered if this dyspnea continues. 
There was no need for a right heart catheterization nor was there any need to pursue further imaging to think about chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. 
It is still unclear why she was no dyspneic and may be a combination of deconditioning , repeated hospitalizations , and will be improved with rehabilitation. 
4. Cardiovascular: Ms. Huertes is exhibiting no signs or ischemia. 
She was maintained on the baby aspirin as well as beta-blocker throughout her hospital stay. 
Ms. Huertes did have a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed an estimated ejection fraction of 45 to 50% , some mid septal and lateral hypokinesis which was old , some mildly thickened aortic valve with no aortic insufficiency , mildly thickened mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation. 
Also , of note she had biatrial enlargement and normal right ventricle size and function. 
After the initial episode of hypertension and hemodialysis , Ms. Huertes was normotensive throughout the remainder of her hospital stay and was discharged on a beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor. 
5. FEN/GI: Ms. Huertes 's abdominal pain resolved on day two of hospitalization and given a negative CT , normal movements , and no further abdominal pain , nausea , or vomiting , it was felt that this may have been related to either due to either viral gastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome. 
The patient was maintained on proton pump inhibition and while inhouse had a low sodium diabetic diet with 1800 calories as well as low potassium for her renal care. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. 2. PhosLo 1334 mg p.o. t.i.d. 3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4. Glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d. 5. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. 7. Senna 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d. 8. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. 9. Tessalon Perles 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. cough.

Discharge Date: ATTENDING: OGDEN , LATORIA M.D. REASON FOR ADMISSION: Ms. Vissman was a transfer from Put Wathern Hospital for further management of severe hypertension. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Vissman is a 72-year-old woman with a history of diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , carotid stenosis status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies in 1996 , chronic kidney disease , and renal artery stenosis , with a history of multiple strokes in the past and recent admission to Totin Hospital And Clinic in October for evaluation of multiple embolic strokes after presenting with weakness. 
She had an extensive evaluation at that time given her history of multiple strokes including: Echo with bubble study ( negative for PFO or intraventricular clot ) , EF 60-65% , no transesophageal echo was done at that time , CRP and ESR were elevated , and she has been worked up for vasculitis in the past , which had been nonrevealing. 
At that time , she denied any lightheadedness , chest pain , palpitations or shortness of breath prior to this episode and she did not remember the episode. 
No focal weakness or changes in sensation , no vision changes. 
On review of systems , she denied any fevers or chills , diaphoresis , recent URI , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea , abdominal pain or dysuria. 
There was no hemorrhage. 
She had severe hypertension during her admission there , which was difficult to control and headache that was treated with Tylenol , Motrin , and morphine IV. Systolic blood pressures ranged between 117 and 220. 
Histamine H2 inhibitors cause possible diarrhea. 
Fluoxetine increased depression. 
She is a former secretary and she denies alcohol. 
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Temperature was 96.7 , heart rate 74 , blood pressure 170/86 , respiratory rate 16 , oxygen saturation 99% on 2 L. In general , she is awake and alert , lying in bed in no acute distress. 
She was not able to cooperate with visual field exam. 
Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , nondistended. 
There was no abdominal bruit. 
She had no hyperreflexia in her biceps or her patella. 
There was no change from prior. 
Lungs otherwise well expanded and clear , no significant effusions were seen and the cardiomediastinal contours were stable with a normal size heart , calcification in the arch the aorta and mildly tortuous descending aorta. 
She had an echo on 10/6/07 that was negative for any intracardiac shunt. 
She had also had a Holter monitor in October that revealed a few short runs of SVT that were most likely atrial tachycardias , but there was no atrial fibrillation. 
There was no evidence of hemodynamically significant disease in the left carotid artery. 
This revealed: 1. Multifocal peripheral cortical infarcts of different ages and bilateral anterior and posterior circulations with newly developed foci of acute infarct between 1 and 14 days days old that suggests ongoing embolism. 
Cardiac , aortic or carotid source of emboli should be considered. 
3. Moderate focal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery origin as described , no visualization of the proximal and mid segment of the nondominant right vertebral artery as described. 
There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
There was no left ventricular thrombus detected. 
There was no cardiac source of embolus identified and compared with prior study on 4/18/07 and 10/6/07 , there was no significant change. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Vissman is a 72-year-old woman with multiple medical problems including severe vasculopathy ( carotid stenosis and renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stent placement in 8/4 ) , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and multiple strokes. 
She was transferred here for management of her severe hypertension and worsening kidney function. 
Her antihypertensives include labetalol 300 mg p.o. q.8 h. 
Given the patient's kidney disease and severe hypertension in addition to recent renal artery stent placement , Nephrology was consulted as well during her hospital stay. 
It was felt that there was no need for intervention regarding her renal arteries or visualization of her kidneys at this time. 
Her clonidine could also be titrated up by 0.1 mg increments should she need more blood pressure control in the future , if her heart rate does not tolerate higher doses of labetalol. 
The patient also has a history of diabetes and is on insulin and her insulin regimen including NPH and AC coverage were titrated during this hospital admission.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mr. Cubeta is a very pleasant 59 year-old man who presents with a history of morbid obesity , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ejection fraction of 40 percent who presents status post a fall and with increasing urinary frequency. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Cubeta has morbid obesity and is currently at a weight of 450 pounds and also has a history of fluctuating weight with decrease in weight to 200 pounds with dieting. 
He also has obstructive sleep apnea on continuous positive airway pressure , history of atrial fibrillation and is not anticoagulated per his primary care physician. 
It was felt at that time by neurosurgery and neurology to be multifactorial and no consistent with disk or cord impingement. 
He was treated for a urinary tract infection at that time with Bactrim for resolution of his incontinence and he was not anticoagulated by his primary care physician. 
Over the past few days he noted also increasing urinary frequency without burning or urinary incontinence , no fever or chills and no costovertebral angle tenderness or pain. 
The night of admission , at 7:30 p.m. while getting up from a chair , his right leg gave out and he fell to the floor "gracefully" without injury or head trauma , no loss of consciousness. 
He had no preceeding dizziness , chest pain , shortness of breath or paresthesia and presented to the Emergency Room at the Pagham University Of .  
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is a morbidly obese man in no acute distress , sitting in a chair. 
Jugular venous distention not appreciated. 
EXTREMITIES: Right calf was with a shallow , erythematous dry ulcer which was chronic with changes consistent with venous insufficiency and varicose veins. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological: The neurology service came by to see the patient in the Emergency Room and felt that there was no acute neurologic change but if the patient was unable to walk he should be sent to rehabilitation. 
They saw no new acute change and he should continue to be followed by neurology in clinic. 
He will be started on a trial of Lasix p.o. q day to decrease his peripheral edema to help him with rehabilitation and his primary care physician will continue to follow him for his atrial fibrillation and he does elect not to anticoagulate him at the moment though Coumadin should be a consideration given his risk of stroke.

In 9/19 , she had a MIBI which was negative for reversible perfusion defect and in 6/10 , she had an echo that showed normal left ventricular size and left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with a large left atrium. 
She was treated with intravenous Lopressor and Lasix and ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
One day prior to admission , the patient noted the onset of increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. 
She was in atrial fibrillation at 100 and her laboratories were within normal limits. 
She returned to the Emergency Ward several hours later with persistent shortness of breath now complaining of substernal chest pain. 
She was given Lasix 20 mg intravenously in the Emergency Room.

RECORD #578
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Morbid obesity. 
A CT scan was performed which revealed a 12 cm x 7 cm x 4.5 cm fluid collection lateral to the hip extending into the surrounding soft tissues with question of contiguity with the nail/intramedullary space. 
Given the patient's history with general anesthesia including desaturations and difficulty with ventilation experienced on irrigation and debridement in April 2004 management aims were directed towards the conservative if at all possible. 
A gram stain revealed 4+ PMNs and no growth on aerobic or anaerobic cultures. 
Blood cultures drawn the following day also showed no growth. 
The Infectious Disease Service continued to follow the patient in house with recommendations to continue vancomycin without rifampin that had been suggested upon previous discharge and despite her itchiness with infusions since no other signs of symptoms of allergic or anaphylactic reaction had occurred. 
Continued monitoring of vancomycin levels were therefore not recommended. 
Due to continued drainage from the catheterized wound , the decision was made for treatment of the hip by a multistage procedure , in which the hardware would be removed and antibiotics spacer placed temporarily while longterm IV antibiotic treatment was pursued for at least six weeks and finally the hip replaced with total arthroplasty , once evidence suggested that infection had been cleared. 
The procedure proceeded without complication including any anesthetic events as had occurred in the past. 
Gram stain from intramedullary reamings showed 2+ polys with no organisms and cultures revealed no growth. 
This too proceeded without intraoperative complications , however , postoperatively , it was found that the spacer head was slightly dislocated. 
Given the increased pain , the obvious shortening of the leg with external rotation and without neurovascular compromise the patient was counseled that operative exploration and replacement of the spacer would be recommended. 
They did not recommend any changes in her current antidepressant regimen but did suggest continued support by social work. 
The patient arrived on the prednisone taper which was eventually discontinued per patient wishes and agreement with her rheumatologist , her last dose was on 7/30/05 and she will not continue with prednisone thereafter.

Discharge Date: 1/16/2006 ATTENDING: MOLTER , ROXANNA MD CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient came in with chief complaint of altered mental status and questionable fever. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 82-year-old male with multiple medical problems , coronary artery disease status post CABG , congestive heart failure with EF of 30% in 2005 , diabetes , and renal insufficiency with several recent hospitalizations who is discharged from the hospital on 8/24/06 status post a CHF exacerbation , and a pneumonia , and an UTI in the previous admission was complicated with Pseudomonas and was treated with ceftriaxone , but then later on cefepime. 
The patient's extremities , on the right lower extremity was noted to be amputated of metatarsals and in the left extremity , posterior distal 5-cm area has a erythematous , warm area of pus muscle and fascia exposed , no bone area of overt necrosis. 
The patient's chest x-ray show questionable right pulmonary edema versus pneumonia and the patient also had received an echo in the past , which shows an EF 30% , an LVH , hypokinesis of the anterior wall and a mild MR. EKG was sinus and mild left axis on admission day. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. Infectious Disease: The patient has this open ulcer on the left lower extremity on the posterior thigh shows a 5-8 cm area of erythematous fascia and muscle exposed likely may be cellulitis , but at the time of admission , there was no pus drainage , but erythema was noted with given patient's history of diabetes and recent hospitalization and also pseudomonal infection from the wound , so the patient will start to treat with vancomycin and Zosyn. 
Plastic surgery was consulted and asked for wet-to-dry dressing and MRI was also achieved and shows no signs of osteomyelitis and Plastic also thinks that the wound has been well taken care of during his stay at the hospital , and the lesion has been stable. 
2. Pulmonary: There were no active issues. 
There was a questionable pneumonia , however , it was resolved spontaneously with antibiotic treatment and chest x-ray has been unremarkable with his following chest x-ray. 
The last chest x-ray that he received was on 2/5/06 prior to discharge and it shows moderate degenerative changes of the mid thoracic spine , but no significant infiltrates was noted and no focal area of consolidations. 
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of coronary artery disease status post a CABG and a congestive heart failure with EF of 30% status post recent admission for CHF on exacerbation. 
The patient was admitted to the hospital with the monitoring of strict Ins and Outs with daily weight but no apparent active issues during the hospital stay. 
The patient has a fluid restricted diet of less tan 1500 mL and the patient was on antihypertensive , aspirin , Plavix , as well as on a cardiovascular diet. 
So , we had to increase his Lasix to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. at the beginning because of mildly elevated BNP , however , we decreased a Lasix to 40 mg daily due to over diuresis and the patient has been doing well for with negative diuresis of about 1 liter. 
4. Hematology: The patient hematocrit has been stable , however , that has been stable at 37 and on discharge it was 32 ( please refer to GI for details ). 5. GI: The patient had a blood cards , has been no issues of irregular bowel movement about once every two days has been on a bowel regimen. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Gastroenterology: The patient has no active GI issues during this whole hospital stay. 
A GI consult was called from Berlcal Hospital , Dr. Jerabek , and Dr. Jerabek reveals that that the patient actually had a colonoscopy about a year ago , which shows diverticuli , hemorrhoids as well as a cecal AVM that is not actively bleeding. 
Dr. Gumina , who was the attending at this point in time , recommended that we should follow up one more set of labs to make sure that the patient was not actively bleeding prior to discharge , and the patient's hematocrit on 11/12/06 , morning , was 32 as well as on 8/16/05 , morning , was 33 and it was stable. 
Overnight , the patient did not have any bowel movement. 
Endocrine: In terms of endocrine , the patient is a type II diabetic , which was covered by sliding scale , and the patient does have elevated TSH , low TFTs , and due to the patient's history of lithium use , there is no need for Synthroid currently. 
If insulin is less than 125 , should not give any units , if it is between 125 and 150 , give 2 units , if it is between 151 and 200 , should given 3 units subcutaneously , if it is between 201 and 250 , should give 4 units , if it is between 251 and 300 , should give 6 units , and if it is between 301 to 350 , should give 8 units , and if higher than 350 , should give 10 units. 
p.r.n. for upset stomach , he will not be discharged to rehabilitation center with magnesium , Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg twice weekly , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. p.r.n. for anxiety and usually given at bedtime , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q.6 h. 
No CRP , no defibrillation , and no intubation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 60-year-old white male who presented with a two week history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion admitted with new EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction for rule out MI. The patient's cardiac risk factors are diabetes , hypertension , distant smoking history. 
An EKG at that time showed no change from an EKG of a year earlier. 
There was one event on 7 of July where the patient experienced chest pain with severe diaphoresis and a chill which he attributed to the flu although the patient did not seek medical attention at that time. 
There was no nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , cyanosis. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension of approximately 10 years , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus of approximately 12 years , left Bell's palsy in 1985 treated with prednisone , type IV hypolipoproteinemia. 
This was attributed to TIA. Carotid non-invasives at that time along with a head CT were reportedly negative. 
He denies family history of coronary artery disease , hypertension or diabetes. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin white male in no acute distress sitting up on the stretcher. 
Fundi were poorly visualized secondary to possible partial cataract. 
Neck was supple , no adenopathy. 
His carotids were 1+ bilaterally without bruits. 
The chest was dull to percussion halfway up , however , there were no rales , wheezes or rhonchi noted. 
Cardiac exam revealed jugular venous pulse was approximately 7 cm at 30 degrees , regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 with loud S4 , otherwise no murmur or rub. 
Abdominal exam demonstrated bowel sounds were present , non-tender , liver span 8 cm in midclavicular line. 
There was no spleen tip palpable. 
Rectal exam normal tone with a firm prostate without masses and stool was guaiac negative. 
There are no femoral bruits. 
Neuro exam was non-focal. 
Portable chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with fluid in the minor fissures , question of cardiomegaly , increasing pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure. 
However , there was no mural thrombus seen although occult thrombi could not be excluded at that time. 
The patient's beta blocker was held because of the concern for wall motion abnormalities and possible aneurysm formation. 
The patient had no chest pain. 
There was no evidence for ischemia. 
There were , therefore , no signs of ischemia , however , there was some mild transient loss of uptake consistent with CHF. 
Because of the evidence for an evolved myocardial infarction the decision was made that this patient would not be a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting and so cardiac catheterization was deferred at this time.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE: Aspiration pneumonia , line infection , refractor asthma. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 59-year-old female well known to the team on admission with a history of COPD/asthma , history of intubation , CHF ( EF of 30% ) , diabetes , schizoaffective disorder who presents with worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea as well as night sweats from Sa Pehall .  
She denies chest pain , palpitations , lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. 
She received vancomycin 1.5 IV x1 , albuterol and Atrovent nebs stack as well as aspirin. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for COPD/asthma with last pulmonary function tests in October 2005 showing an FVC of 41% , FEV1 of 0.74 liters , 33% , and a ratio of FEV1/FVC of 83%. 
Also , schizoaffective disorder/questionable bipolar , GERD , diabetes , CHF with EF of 30% , and an echo in October 2005 , hypertension and steroid myopathy. 
On general exam , she was morbidly obese , working to breathe , speaking in phrases. 
Her cardiovascular: JVP not visualized secondary to body habitus. 
Abdomen was soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. 
On the differential her white blood count was 93 polys , no bands. 
Chest x-ray: Portable AP view with stable cardiomegaly , questionable of lower lobe infiltrate but no evidence of CHF. 
ANALYSIS AND PLAN: On admission , this is a 59-year-old female with history of recent COPD and asthma exacerbation , diabetes , CHF , who presents with worsening shortness of breath and suspected right middle lobe pneumonia. 
She was not found to be volume overloaded on admission , and she had a D-Dimer that was negative as well. 
Her restrictive lung disease is most likely secondary to her body habitus leading to obesity hyperventilation syndrome and her obstructive disease have components of asthma since has responsive bronchodilation after beta-agonist. 
The management of her respiratory status involved initially starting on steroids , prednisone 60 mg , frequent nebs , as well as continuing her Advair and Singulair. 
It was also planned to use BiPAP since she might have sleep apnea component despite no objective data supporting that. 
On ventilation , the patient initially required AC since she was not able to maintain good total volumes on pressure support. 
She underwent a PEG and tracheostomy placement by Dr. Bancourt with no complications. 
, as well as vancomycin. 
She also received a 14 day course of vancomycin after the central venous lines were removed and since then she has been afebrile and all blood cultures after October have been negative , so about 10 days with negative blood cultures and sputum cultures. 
Just prior to discharge , her left IJ line will be removed since she just finished her course of antibiotics as well as her peripheral A line. 
Her diabetes was managed with Lantus 100 units a day with Portland Insulin Protocol on initial ICU stay transitioned to Regular Insulin scale. 
She was not needing any extra insulin units prior to discharge. 
There was no angina or new changes in EKG during this admission. 
We plan to restart her on a small-dose ACE inhibitor prior to discharge with the objective of better blood pressure control as well as renal protection from her diabetes. 
We will not restart Isordil since patient had no evidence of coronary artery disease. 
Psych: We will continue home regimen of Trileptal , Depakote as well as Risperdal. 
Heme: Her hematocrit has remained stable during this admission. 
Since she was getting multiple blood draws , she received about 2 units of packed red blood cells and all her workup for a source of anemia was negative including vitamin B12 , including iron studies as well. 
Her heme ?__? panel was also negative. 
Musculoskeletal: Patient had an infiltrative ?___? on her left arm around her peripheral IV access. 
There were no signs of evident infection in the site and healing since that event has been quite good. 
There are some signs of granulation tissue in the ulcer base but no erythema or pus around it. 
Physical Therapy has been involved in the case and have been doing tremendous work in putting her sitting upright , as well as gaining increased strength on her extremity.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Houghton is an 81 year old gentleman with a history of hypertension , aortic insufficiency status post aortic valve replacement , congestive heart failure and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair who was stable with baseline dyspnea on exertion until the day prior to admission when he went out to take the garbage. 
He denies any prodrome syndrome and denies loss of bowel or bladder function. 
He did not recall the event but remembers coming to and his neighbor calling the ambulance. 
He denies any chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitations , associated with the incident and denies any similar event in the past. 
6. Status post cholecystectomy. 
NECK: Reveals jugular venous pressure about 10 centimeters , 2+ carotids , no bruits. 
IMPRESSION: This is an 81 year old gentleman with no known history of coronary artery disease who was status post aortic valve replacement with homograft repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm on Propafenone for atrial fibrillation. 
He was evaluated early on by the electrophysiology service and was started on a low dose beta blocker to prevent him from going back into atrial fibrillation while off the anticoagulation. 
Given this the EP service favored placement of a DDDR/AIDC post cardiac catheterization to rule out any coronary disease. 
Cardiac catheterization was performed on 5/13/99 and he was found to have no coronary artery disease. 
The pacer site looked clean and was not thought to be infected. 
He remained out of atrial fibrillation and was not anticoagulated. 
This revealed multiple facial fractures but no orbital floor fracture. 
The ophthalmology service was consulted and their opinion was that he had a normal examination and no evidence of ocular muscle entrapment , optic neuropathy or globe malposition. 
Therefore no operative intervention was required for his periorbital fractures.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Cardiovascular: The patient was started on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zocor , heparin , and a 2B3A inhibitor before cardiac catheterization. 
Following cardiac catheterization the patient had no further episodes of chest pain and remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course. 
Following cardiac catheterization the patient developed acute renal failure secondary to IV contrast with a creatinine peaking at 6.8 , and then improving gradually to 4.2 upon discharge. 
A renal ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of obstruction , but did show several simple cysts , as well as a calcified cyst which was further evaluated by CT scan , which demonstrated a likely hyperdense cyst , but follow-up MRI was recommended to more definitively rule out the possibility of a neoplasm. 
Ultrasound showed no evidence of clots in the bladder. 
Heme: Following cardiac catheterization , the patient developed epistaxis , frank hematuria , and coffee-ground emesis ( secondary to swallowing blood and not a GI bleed ). 
The hematuria resolved , and no clots were seen on abdominal ultrasound. 
Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was maintained on TZI sliding scale while in-house , later was restarted on his home regimen of insulin 70/30 , and was discharged on this home regimen.

In the interim , the patient denied any associated nausea , vomiting , fever , or diarrhea. 
She was subsequently scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy with an open cholecystectomy , which took place on 6/25/2005 . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Relapsing polychondritis with associated interstitial lung disease , tracheal , ear cartilage and nose involvement , managed with dapsone , adalimumab , and steroids at home; morbid obesity; COPD/OSA on CPAP at home; osteoporosis; bilateral avascular necrosis of the hip; depression. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no notable alcohol , tobacco or IV drug use history. 
The patient's general exam is notable for a morbidly obese , middle-aged female. 
The patient demonstrated no evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction. 
Abdomen was noted to morbidly obese , soft , nondistended with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. 
Extremities noted to demonstrate mild peripheral edema with warm and well-perfused clinical examination and no evidence of acute run of ischemia. 
UA was noted to be clear without evidence of urinary tract infection. 
EKG was notable for normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute without evidence of acute ischemia. 
Preoperative plain film of the chest demonstrated unremarkable sinus and no acute cardiopulmonary process seen. 
Following extensive review by the above-named services , the patient was cleared for operative intervention and subsequently underwent an open cholecystectomy on 6/25/2005 . 
While in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient could rest well clinically without acute events. 
She was successfully weaned from IV analgesia and was transitioned to oral pain medications without complications. 
Of note , arterial blood gas drawn in the context of this episode demonstrated a widened A-a gradient concerning for a possible coronary embolus. 
Despite this , however , she was successfully weaned to a regimen of intermittent opioid dosing via her G-tube , which she was noted to tolerate without complication. 
With gradual withdrawal of her sedating agents , the patient was noted to be appropriate and responsive and demonstrated no evidence of neurological compromise. 
Of note , the patient at no demonstrated any evidence of acute neurological events or cerebrovascular accidents necessitating further evaluation from a neurological perspective. 
She was noted to move all extremities to command , noted to be appropriate to questioning , demonstrates no evidence of neurological compromise on gross exam. 
As her intraabdominal process progressed , the patient was noted to require increasing support with multiple agents including neosynephrine and vasopressin; however , following appropriate surgical debridement of her intraabdominal bile collection , she was gradually successfully weaned from pressor agents and at no point afterwards required further aggressive pressure therapy in order to maintain adequate pressures. 
She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute myocardial ischemia despite multiple rule out protocols in the setting of hypertensive episodes. 
Serial bedside echocardiograms demonstrated no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction or diminution of ejection fraction and she subsequently was noted to stabilize from cardiovascular perspective. 
Of note , over the course of her admission , the patient was noted to demonstrate periodic episodes of idiopathic bradycardia unrelated to oxygenation status; however , she at no point required external pacing or atropine therapy in order to treat such episodes and was noted on all occasions as spontaneously resolved her bradycardic episodes. 
At the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to be stable with regular rate and rhythm and no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction. 
without complication. 
Followup EKG demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and she has been free of episodes of bradycardia for at least the past 10 days. 
3. Pulmonary: As described above , the inciting events for the patient's return to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #2 was noted to be acute respiratory distress secondary to presumed pulmonary embolus. 
With cessation of her pressors , adequate diuresis was rendered possible and the patient was effectively fluid oscillated for the duration of her Intensive Care Unit stay. 
With diuresis , the patient was subsequently gradually weaned from pressor support to successful trach collar trials , which she accomplished without complication. 
Her respiratory exam demonstrated lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild bibasilar crackles and no additional evidence of acute respiratory failure. 
Her trach site is clean , dry , and intact with no evidence of cuff leak. 
Of note , the patient was noted to demonstrate a 3-liter bile collection intraoperatively with no evidence of bowel injury or ischemia upon performing of this procedure. 
Multiple intraabdominal drains were placed and no evidence of active bile leak was noted at the time of this procedure. 
She thereafter successfully started no tube feeds for nutritional supplementation , which she tolerated without complication. 
Her abdomen was soft , nondistended and nontender with evidence of morbid obesity per her baseline exam. 
Of note , her midline incision was left partially opened in order to promote adequate wean drainage postoperatively and to permit healing by secondary intervention; this incision has continued to remain stable with no evidence of active infection postoperatively. 
The patient is currently running tube feeds at goal via her J-tube without complication. 
Her G-tube continuous to vent appropriately without incident. 
With resolution of her septic physiology , however , the patient was noted to be exuberantly responsive to efforts at diuresis and was quickly noted to be independently productive of large amounts of urine without diuretic therapy. 
She successfully oscillated her fluids through the duration of her admission , at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal failure or electrolyte abnormalities. 
She at no point demonstrated any evidence of a hemodialysis requirement during the course of her admission. 
Her electrolytes remained stable and BUN and creatinine demonstrate no evidence of acute renal failure. 
Following prolonged heparin invasion and gradual stabilization of her clinical status , the patient was gradually transitioned to Coumadin therapy via her J-tube without complication. 
She at no point has demonstrated any evidence of postoperative hemorrhage or bleeding instability; her platelet count has likewise remained stable for the duration of her stay. 
While on Xigris , the patient did not demonstrate any appreciable improvement in her septic status and she was therefore recommended for operative intervention on 3/11/2005 as described above. 
At the time of this discharge , the patient remains afebrile with stable white blood cell count and no additional culture information suggested for ongoing infection. 
She has a stable and appropriately positioned upper extremity PICC line , which is functional and continues to permit adequate dosage of her standing colistin antibiotic regimen. 
Following successful resolution of her septic physiology , however , the patient was successfully weaned from insulin therapy without complication and was noted to demonstrate stable blood sugars for the duration of her stay. 
At no point did she demonstrate any evidence of acute adrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction in the course of her admission.

Discharge Date: 7/21/1995 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY WOUND INFECTION HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54 year old gentleman who is status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 6/15/95 at an outside hospital. 
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by respiratory failure secondary to presumed phrenic nerve injury. 
The patient also developed congestive heart failure. 
The patient now presents to Dr. Burston with infected left lower leg pressure ulcer with open and gangrenous muscle exposed through this posterior wound. 
The patient had no documented febrile episodes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , right sacroiliac joint decubitus ulcer. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin 81 mg po qd 2. Digoxin 0.325 mg po qd 3. Azmacort 6 puffs inhaled bid 4. Heparin 5000 units subcu bid 5. Zantac 150 mg po bid 6. Lasix 40 mg po qd 7. Capoten 25 mg q 8 8. Albuterol nebulizers 0.5 cc in 2.5 cc normal saline qid 9. NPH insulin 38 units subcu bid 10. 
In general , the patient was trached and in no acute distress. 
HEENT: normocephalic , atraumatic head. 
No S3 or S4 were noted. 
The patient had no obvious murmurs. 
The patient was obese. 
Abdomen was nontender , nondistended with no palpable masses. 
Left lower extremity revealed three open ulcers with marked gangrenous muscle exposure. 
The patient had a Dopplerable posterior tibial with cold pulses but no Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room on 9/11/95 for a preoperative diagnosis of a left lower extremity infected pressure sore. 
Intraoperatively , the patient was noted to have necrosis of both heads of the gastrocnemius muscle including the soleus and also a portion of the lateral compartment. 
During this procedure , some necrotic skin , subcutaneous tissue and fascia were noted and were sharply debrided free. 
The wound was relatively clean upon completion of the procedure with no apparent loculations or collections or purulence. 
The muscle also at this time appeared viable and it was considered that the wound may heal on its own. 
The left foot remained cool and insensate with no motor function. 
After adequate irrigation and debridement , it was felt that the patient would not require amputation of his lower extremity given the viability of the muscle. 
The patient however did appear to have some episodes of anxiety for which he was placed on Klonopin 1 mg po tid. 
The patient's tidal volumes were consistently elevated over 600 and the patient had no subjective complaints of shortness of breath. 
However , on postoperative day #4 and #2 , the patient noted some difficulty catching his breath. 
The test revealed no diaphragmatic excursion consistent with phrenic nerve injury. 
It was decided at this time that the patient would remain on his previous ventilator settings of 10 of pressure support and 5 of CPAP and 50% FIO2 and no further weaning would be attempted. 
Because we do not have this at our institution , the patient was started on a similar formula of full strength Ensure High Protein at 105 cc/hour. 
However , because the patient appears to have no reason for not encouraging his oral intake , the patient's tube feeds were decreased to 50 cc/hour throughout the day for a 12 hour period and po intake at this time was encouraged. 
The patient was placed back on his normal subcutaneous doses of insulin NPH 38 units in the morning and 38 units at night. 
Once the patient's inner thighs heal , the patient may have the Foley removed and the patient may be able to void on his own in either a bedside urinal or with a condom cath in place. 
The patient was initially ruled out for a myocardial infarction following his first operative procedure. 
The patient has had no complaints of chest pain. 
The patient had no episodes of hypotension and has been continued on his Capoten. 
The patient has been stable with no issues. 
Because of the time of operation , it was considered that the infectious tissue was completely debrided , and the patient does not need to continue on an extensive antibiotic course. 
The patient will not be receiving any IV medications and will continue on oral antibiotic dosings.

189350399 | PUO | 02584657 | | 0896201 | 6/26/2007 12:00:00 AM | rheumatoid arthritis | Unsigned | DIS | Admission Date: 7/4/2007 Report Status: Unsigned 
Discharge Date: 5/27/2007 ATTENDING: MOOSE , BUCK M.D. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , sickle cell trait and chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ). 
For her rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , she had been long treated with methotrexate and allopurinol. 
She denied fevers , chills , loose stools , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting or other constitutional symptoms aside from a headache on the day of admission. 
Her pain especially in her hip was so severe at the time of admission that she felt that she was not able to walk. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Rheumatoid and gouty arthritis: Previously on methotrexate and allopurinol , but due to worsening renal insufficiency , methotrexate was stopped in 5/3 , and Plaquenil was started in 7/21 .  
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes. 
7. Chronic kidney disease , baseline creatinine of 1.9 ( ?of whether this is due to renal tubular acidosis or diabetes ). 
HEENT: Extraocular muscles were intact , mucous membranes are moist , neck was supple , JVP was not noticeably elevated. 
Abdomen: Soft , diffusely tender especially in the left and right lower quadrants , with a question of rebound in these distributions as well. 
Extremities: Warm and well perfused , no cyanosis/clubbing/edema. 
Extremities: Exquisite tenderness to palpation over the left hip ( due to severe pain , the patient could not be positioned in lateral decubitus position to accurately assess for bursal pain ) , positive left hip pain on internal and external rotation of the hip , and positive left elbow pain , along with pain in multiple other areas , without obvious erythema , effusion , warmth or trauma. 
HER RELEVANT STUDIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: On 10/3/07 , pelvic and hip x-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing of the right SI joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the left hip. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait and chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted for diffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to a rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Body aches and joint pains: The differential diagnosis for the patient's body aches and joint pains initially included a rheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease , intra-abdominal process or Plaquenil reaction. 
A left hip aspiration was attempted by Interventional Radiology; no fluid was obtainable , so a washing followed by drainage was performed , which had a negative Gram-stain and negative cultures. 
Similarly , blood cultures were negative , and an echocardiogram revealed no evidence of endocarditis as an explanation for her MRSA urinary tract infection. 
By process of elimination , therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains was therefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although of note , her ESR and CRP were a bit higher than would be expected for a rheumatoid arthritis flare. 
Due to hip pain and one mild fever to the range of 100.6-100.9 with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 11 to 15 , Interventional Radiology did a hip wash and aspirate that was negative , as well as a transthoracic echo that was negative for evidence of endocarditis. 
This is partly from pain , and partly from poor control of her central hypertension. 
Because of refractory hypertension , we recommend that she undergo renal artery imaging as an outpatient.

RECORD #620
He was noted in triage to have a blood pressure of 210/130 and was triaged to urgent. 
The patient has had a long-standing history of hypertension and he stopped his medications actually about two months ago when he ran out of prescriptions. 
Following this the patient began to note some difficulty with dyspnea on exertion and has also noted some altered sensations in his chest during the week prior to admission , which lasted approximately one to two seconds and occurred primarily at rest. 
These occurred across his chest but did not radiate. 
He has had no orthopnea. 
Basically , over the past three weeks the patient has noted ( 1 ) his irregular heart beat , as if he is missing beats , although he does not note any tachycardia , ( 2 ) dyspnea on exertion , including orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and ( 3 ) intermittent substernal chest pain which occurs only at rest and not with exertion. 
He described this as an ache and stated it did not radiate. 
The episodes lasted , at the most , four to five minutes , and resolved on their own without any other symptoms. 
He denies any syncope or presyncope. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes hypertension , LVH , asthma , increased cholesterol , borderline diabetes mellitus , obesity , gastritis , allergic rhinitis , depression , osteoarthritis , chronic right knee effusion , and impotence , status post penile implant. 
He has not taken these in the past two months. 
He does not smoke , drink or use any drugs. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His physical examination showed a black male in no acute distress. 
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. 
There were no murmurs. 
The abdomen had normal bowel sounds and was soft , mildly obese and non-tender. 
There was no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Right knee was very swollen and he had right calf tenderness but no cord. 
Examination was non-focal. 
Chest x-ray showed increased cardiac silhouette , PVR , and there were no infiltrates. 
The knee film showed a large effusion , which was present in the past , and some osteoarthritis but no sign of fracture. 
The patient had lower extremity non invasives which were negative and a VQ scan which was read as between low and intermediate probability. 
ASSESSMENT: This is a 60 year old man with long-standing hypertension , now off medications for two months. 
He presented with new atrial fibrillation , mild congestive heart failure and intermittent atypical chest pain. 
Given symptoms were predated by a leg injury , his lower extremity non invasives were negative and VQ scan was low to intermediate probability , the possibility of pulmonary embolism was not further pursued. 
Likely mechanism is poorly controlled hypertension and conduction system disease causing atrial flutter and congestive heart failure. 
His low rate is worrisome for intrinsic conduction disease and it was considered that there was no need for anticoagulation for atrial flutter. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: As noted , the patient had lower extremity non invasives and VQ scans which were essentially negative and he was not treated for pulmonary embolism , as it was considered to be ruled out. 
He ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
The patient's admission was without complication.

An ACE test was positive but beta hydroxybutyrate was negative with triponin of 0. WBC 7 , hematocrit 37 , platelet count 167. 
Urinalysis was remarkable for 3+ glucose with no ketones , 1+ esterace , negative nitrite , 20 to 25 white blood cells , 2 to 3 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , and 1+ yeast. 
ASSESSMENT: In short , this is a 65 year old woman with known two vessel coronary artery disease , hypertension , and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus under poor glycemic control recently , now presenting with hyperglycemia , dehydration , and new ECG changes suggestive of lateral ischemia. 
She was admitted for rule out of myocardial infarction and monitoring. 
There was no evolution or change in these throughout the course of the admission. 
On 10/22/98 the patient underwent a Dobutamine MIBI study after discussion with her primary care physician and cardiologist , Dr. Abshear , who felt that this would be a helpful study , given her difficult history and known underlying coronary artery disease. 
The results of the Dobutamine study were that she had no ECG changes and the MIBI images showed lateral and inferior infarcts but no active ischemia. 
A follow-up chest x-ray was done which did not show any evidence of congestive heart failure. 
The patient had no other active cardiac issues during this admission. 
At the time of admission there was some question as to whether she might have a urinary tract infection given her urinalysis; however , a urine culture came back negative. 
The white blood cells in her urine on admission were not present on a subsequent specimen which was obtained by straight catheterization and the thought was that the initial pyuria was probably related to vaginal candidiasis. 
It is possible that she has sleep apnea given her body habitus and this would warrant follow-up as an outpatient. 
Orthopedics: At the time of the admission the patient had a set of lumbosacral spine films done in order to rule out injuries related to her fall. 
She was started on Cisapride for presumptive element of diabetic gastroparesis , in addition to being maintained on her Prilosec. 
In addition , she had recently had a barium study in April of 1996 that showed no abnormalities. 
It was decided that this study did not warrant repeating at this point. 
Neurologic: On several occasions during this admission the patient became acutely confused. 
At these times she was not noted to have a focal neurological examination. 
These instances appeared questionably related to dosing of her Compazine and also all seemed to occur in the evening. 
However , since the patient remained with a normal WBC and no purulent sputum , it was thought unlikely that she had pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE: A 68-year-old male with history of CAD status post three-vessel CABG , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , admitted for workup of chest pain , ruled out for MI. 
The patient was admitted for further workup and cardiac catheterization. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed three-vessel CAD with patent grafts to the right circumflex and LAD. 
Proximal LAD to diagonals were not bypassed. 
The decision was made by the clinical team and the referring physician for further medical management controlling blood pressure and return for repeat cardiac catheterization PCI of the protected left main , approximately the two diagonals if symptoms recur. 
The patient was continued on aspirin , statin , beta-blocker and lisinopril was started. 
The patient had no evidence of heart failure. 
Given that the patient presented with severe hypertension the fludrocortisone was discontinued. 
During his hospitalization , the patient was monitored on tele and no events were noted. 
Chest x-ray and urinalysis were sent to rule out infectious process actually to explain his confusion and these were unremarkable. 
The patient was pretreated with Mucomyst and bicarbonate pre and post cardiac catheterization.

Discharge Date: 5/18/1999 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year-old male with known coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction who presented with new onset of dyspnea on exertion. 
The cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease and the patient presented for coronary artery bypass grafting. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetes mellitus , gastroesophageal reflux disease , peripheral vascular disease , and peripheral neuropathy. 
The patient was kept NPO at this time as he was not able to tolerate p.o. intake without nausea. 
The patient continued to have an elevated creatinine of 1.7 , down from 1.9 earlier and a hematocrit of 32.8 with no signs of bleeding. 
The patient was again seen by the electrophysiology service for possible change in his rhythm. 
The rhythm was Wenckebach and the patient was evaluated for a possible pacemaker. 
On postoperative day six and seven the patient continued to do extremely well with no change in his management. 
There was no change in his management. 
The patient was therefore discharged without complications and with placement of the pacemaker on 2/8/99 .

RECORD #624
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73 year old gentleman with a past medical history of hypertension who presented to Dr. Cassetty at the Osri Medical Center on 9/1/94 after a couple of episodes of heavy diaphoresis and nausea , an identifiable precipitant. 
His EKG there revealed new T wave inversions in the inferior leads and he was admitted to the Osri Medical Center where he ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
Because of his baseline conduction system disease , an exercise tolerance test could not be performed and the patient was sent for an exercise tolerance test thallium. 
However , prior to the test , the patient became diaphoretic and nauseous with a non-palpable blood pressure. 
Because he was felt too unstable to undergo a nuclear imaging , he was transferred to the Pagham University Of to undergo cardiac catheterization. 
The patient denied any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , or peripheral edema. 
He also denied any recent change in exercise tolerance. 
He also has a history of degenerative joint disease and a history of mild asthma. 
His coronary risk factors include hypertension , obesity , gender , and age. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This was a well-developed pleasant male in no apparent distress with a blood pressure of 154/82 , heart rate 74 , and respirations 14. 
NECK: Supple with no jugular venous distention and he had a left carotid bruit , however , his carotid upstrokes were normal. 
CARDIAC: Examination revealed a very quiet precordium with a regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
EXTREMITIES: Revealed femoral pulses 2+ without bruits , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses 1+ bilaterally , and he had no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
His chest X-Ray at Osri Medical Center revealed an enlarged heart with no pulmonary infiltrates , his EKG from 3/6/94 at the Osri Medical Center revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 , left posterior hemi-block with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay , and poor R wave progression across his precordium. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 10/16/94 which revealed hemodynamics of a right atrial mean of 6 , a right ventricular pressure of 28/6 , a pulmonary capillary mean pressure of 14 , he had a totally occluded mid left anterior descending lesion , a tight second diagonal lesion , a totally occluded OM1 lesion , and a 70% distal right coronary artery lesion. 
It was felt that his symptoms may be an indication of more advanced conduction system disease that would possibly justify a pacer. 
He had no symptoms during the 24 hours of Holter monitoring. 
He exercise tolerance test MIBI examination revealed a modified Bruce protocol on which he went twelve minutes stopping secondary to leg fatigue , he had no chest pain , his maximum heart rate was 112 , his maximum blood pressure was 195/95 , he had no change in his baseline EKG as well as no ST changes , and no arrhythmias. 
Given the above information , particularly the fact that the patient did not degenerate to more severe conduction system disease with exercise , it was felt that a pacer would not be necessary at this time. 
It is noteworthy that the patient had no episodes of nausea or diaphoresis during his hospitalization , that is ambulating without assistance with no symptoms whatsoever.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 83-year-old man with a history of diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , bilateral above the knee amputations , dementia who presented on 1/1/06 to the Totin Hospital And Clinic Emergency Department with mental status changes including increased confusion and decreased responsiveness over the past two to three days. 
His son also reports that the patient had decreased urine output over the past two days with decreased p.o. intake as well. 
Although , the patient did not complain of nausea , vomiting , fevers , diarrhea , chest pain , or shortness of breath. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease , status post bilateral above the knee amputations , diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent , dementia , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , anemia or chronic disease , traumatic brain injury in October 2002 , which included a subdural hematoma and a subarachnoid hemorrhage , also congestive heart failure with the ejection fraction of 28% measured in September of 2002 , history of C. diff colitis and polymyalgia rheumatica and hypertension. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: Include Lantus , lisinopril , Ritalin. 
He had no jugular venous distention. 
His heart had regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. 
His abdomen was soft and nondistended , positive bowel sounds. 
Bilateral above the knee amputations with no signs of infection from the past surgical site. 
He had no thorough reflex. 
On initial examination , he had increased tone in his upper left extremity and he was moving his left upper extremity but not his right. 
His EKG showed sinus bradycardia with T-wave inversions in I , aVL , V3 through V6 with no ST changes. 
Compared to a prior EKG in July of 2004 , there were no acute changes. 
A UA was sent from that specimen , which showed greater than 200 white blood cells , 3+ leuk esterase , negative nitrites , and 2+ bacteria. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: ID: The patient was admitted initially with the diagnosis of mental status changes and urosepsis given the grossly positive urine in the Foley and a positive UA. Urine culture was sent. 
He was fluid hydrated with normal saline bolus of 500 mL in a rate of 100 mL per hour after that. 
The urine culture eventually did not grow out any bacteria , but did grow out greater than 100 , 000 candida. 
Further into his hospital course , he again spiked the temperature on 5/23/06 to 101.6 degrees with transient hypertension with the systolics into the 80s. 
Another urine culture , blood culture and chest x-ray were done at that time. 
Blood cultures eventually did not grow out anything as well as the urine , which was also negative. 
At that time , we had conversation with the patient's healthcare proxy who is Daryl Buol who agreed that no further attempts at IV should be made and we should continue to not have a Foley catheter in place. 
On exam the next morning , he continued to be obtunded and did not seem to be moving his right arm. 
We did however obtained a transthoracic echocardiogram , which showed an ejection fraction of 30% and no thrombus , which could have been the nadirs for the stroke. 
We also got carotid ultrasounds , which did show 75% stenosis in the right ICA and 1% to 25% stenosis on the left , which would not explain the stroke on the left side. 
We also checked a lipid panel and started a low dose of simvastatin to prevent further stroke evaluation and formation. 
Cardiovascular: He has a presumed history of coronary artery disease given his low ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities seen on the echocardiogram. 
We started a low dose of atenolol with hold parameters as well as lisinopril and as mentioned before , we continued aspirin. 
He did not take a lot of p.o. during his hospital course and was only able to be fed by members of his family with any real efficacy. 
Given the patient's new large left MCA stroke , which has left him functionally debilitated , several end of life care discussions were held with the patient's healthcare proxy Daryl Buol and as well as with the patient's son who seemed to be his primary care giver. 
They have all come to the agreement that the patient would not wants to have aggressive interventions done , which include CPR , intubation , pressors , and at this point as well they feel that interventions such as IV fluids or Foley catheters are not in order as well. 
Several discussions were held about whether the patient should be placed in a skilled nursing facility because of his extraordinary healthcare needs and that he needs to be fed , he needs to have his diaper changed , and his hygiene looked after , but given that the patient's wishes were to go home , the family felt that they would try to take him home and feed him themselves and see how he does and if that did not workout well , they would opt for a more structured living facility for the patient. 
COMPLICATIONS: There were no complications for this hospital stay. 
He was nonverbal. 
He was moving his left upper extremity but not his right using it to scratch his face and forehead. 
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs appreciated. 
His abdomen was nondistended and soft and nontender. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. 
p.r.n. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily , Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum daily p.r.n. for constipation , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , milk of magnesia 30 mL p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. for constipation , Ritalin 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Lantus 6 units subcu daily. 
He has some blood cultures , which have been no growth to date , but final cultures are pending and if they are grossly abnormal , these results will be telephoned to him by the microbiology lab. 
Unfortunately , his office was closed and an appointment was not able to be schedule before discharge.

PROCEDURE: Attempted lumbar puncture on 9/23/05 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 81-year-old male with history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , atrial fibrillation , giant cell arteritis , and congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function , who presents with generalized weakness. 
The patient reports feeling poorly for about two years since his diagnosis with giant cell arteritis , but denied any acute change over the past several days prior to admission. 
He denied focal weakness , slurred speech , bowel or bladder incontinence , loss of consciousness and had no witnessed seizure activity. 
He also denied chest pain , palpitations , shortness of breath , increased dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , and also had no report of fever , cough , dysuria , urinary frequency , diarrhea , abdominal pain , jaw claudication , calf tenderness , or vision loss. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function , chronic lower extremity edema , diabetes mellitus type 2 , history of atrial fibrillation s/p DC cardioversion , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , giant cell arteritis , chronic renal insufficiency , history of spinal stenosis , gout , depression , and status post recent left thigh ulcer excision. 
He denies tobacco use but reports alcohol use of one drink a day. 
CV - regular rate with early beats and no murmurs , gallops , or rubs appreciated. 
He responded to IV fluids and did not require pressor support. 
grew gram-negative rods and antibiotics which were changed to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage. 
The source of his bacteremia was unclear , but most likely a bowel origin given its species and would consider microperforation as the possibility. 
A follow-up colonoscopy may be considered as an outpatient. 
Interestingly , on review of his chart , it was also found that the initial ED nursing note per EMS reported right-sided weakness , which must have been transient as well because the ED physician note was without focality.

RECORD #636
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient , Mr. Raver is a 44-year-old married Hispanic male with a history of diabetes; hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; and obstructive sleep apnea , on CPAP , who presented to the P Therford Hospital Emergency Room on November , 2005 , with complaint of shortness of breath. 
His wife reported that he has been experiencing gradually worsening shortness of breath since the afternoon of October , 2005 , without any chest pain. 
The patient's hypertension was difficult to control , requiring labetalol initially and then a successful regimen of IV nitroglycerin , nitroprusside , hydralazine , and Lopressor. 
The patient received a TEE on November , 2005 , which showed concentric LVH , no wall motion abnormalities , and EF of 45%. 
There was a concern for aortic dissection on echocardiogram , but an MRI/MRA revealed no dissection. 
He was started on ASA , heparin , beta-blocker , statin , and Integrilin and transferred to the TTHC on March , 2005 , for management for possible catheterization. 
At the P Therford Hospital ICU , the patient also had marked hyperglycemia and was put on a ??___?? protocol. 
The patient was continued to be maintained on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor while Integrilin was discontinued on CCU day #2 as the patient was not stable for cardiac catheterization. 
The patient also had an episode of sinus pause of greater than 2.5 seconds on September , 2005 , with no symptoms. 
An MRI/MRA was obtained which showed small vessel disease consistent with hypertension-induced cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of embolism. 
Secondary to the patient's mental status and question of inability to swallow , an NG tube was placed; however , it was self-discontinued by the patient on September , 2005. 
The patient was transferred to the cardiology team on January , 2005 , for further medical management prior to cardiac catheterization for the non-ST-elevation MI. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for chest pain , shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , fevers , chills , and dysuria. 
3. Obstructive sleep apnea , on CPAP. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status post cerebrovascular accident secondary to hypertension. 
Positive history of tobacco , no alcohol , and no IV drug use. 
On March , 2005 , his EKG showed ST abnormality and possible lateral subendocardial injury. 
EF was 55% with no wall motion abnormalities. 
4. Renal ultrasound , which showed bilaterally symmetric kidneys with no hydronephrosis. 
5. EEG abnormal consistent with moderate to diffuse cerebral dysfunction , possibly secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy. 
7. All his blood cultures and urine cultures had no growth to date. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 44-year-old male with history of hypertension , diabetes , high cholesterol , and obstructive sleep apnea presenting with hypertensive crisis , pulmonary edema , status post ICU stay complicated by multiple strokes and left-sided weakness , non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction likely demand ischemia secondary to hypertension and agitation , hyperglycemia requiring ??___?? protocol , and question of ICU-acquired pneumonia with spiking fever needing the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. 
The patient was restarted on home medication of clonidine patch as discontinuation can cause labile hypertension. 
Rhythm: The patient had two episodes of sinus pause greater than 3 seconds on September , 2005 , with no episodes since September , 2005. 
It could be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea versus conduction abnormality. 
His beta-blocker was held secondary to the sinus pause. 
However , after the catheterization and with the result of obstructive lesion , the patient was restarted on low-dose beta-blocker with atenolol 25 mg q.d. 2. Pulmonary: When transferred , the patient's sedation was weaned and he was without any pressure on CCU day #4. 
3. ID: The patient had spiked a fever to 104.1 on March , 2005 , with a question of pneumonia. 
He continues to have low-grade fever , but no frank fever over 100.4. 
The patient continued to improve and does not complain of any subjective fever. 
The patient received a nutrition consult for his diabetes and was put on a cardiac and diabetic diet. 
He tolerated the ACE inhibition with no rise in creatinine. 
MRI/MRA showed small vessel disease consistent with hypertension-induced CVA.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENTATION: The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for rectosigmoid cancer complicated with vesicular vaginal fistula status post total pelvic exenteration , cystectomy with ileal loop diversion on February 2004 , obesity , hypoventilation syndrome with chronic respiratory acidosis status post gluteal sacral abscess who was brought to the Emergency Department from a skilled nursing facility with change in mental status and sacral wound infection. 
She had a head CT that showed no acute intracranial abnormality. 
An abdominal CT showed an air fluid collection in the pelvis and some cholelithiasis and a CT PE showed no evidence of PE though admittedly the study was limited and there was a small bilateral pleural effusion and right lower lobe consolidative paucity possibly representing an early pneumonia. 
She is status post total pelvic exenteration with ileal loop diversion in February 2004 , status post XRT in July and September 2004 , status post gluteal sacral abscess August 2004 , status post c-dif colitis in August 2004 , status post e. coli MSS bacteremia in August 2004 , obesity , hypoventilation syndrome. 
She has iron deficiency anemia , GERD , osteoarthritis. 
An echo April 2004 showed normal left ventricular function with an EF of 60% with question of elevated right-sided pressures , LVH and she suffered immobility secondary to XRT with back pain and lower extremity edema , status post total abdominal hysterectomy in August 2001 , and had a pulmonary evaluation in February 2004 in which she was assessed to have obesity , hypoventilation syndrome , nocturnal oxygen desaturation , chronic respiratory acidosis complicated with longstanding obesity hypoventilation syndrome. 
MEDICATIONS: The patient takes Tylenol p.r.n. pain , vitamin C 500 b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 daily , iron sulfate 325 t.i.d. , oxycodone 5 q.4h p.r.n. pain though she does not require that very often , Toprol XL 50 daily , Lovenox 40 subq. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a morbidly obese woman who at the time of the document exam was intubated , vented and sedated. 
She was asleep , did not open her eyes. 
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , and no bowel sounds were appreciated. 
Skin was not notable for any rashes or petechiae. 
She has known obesity hypoventilation syndrome. 
The patient did report needing bipap at night at one point though later on it was felt that she was not on bipap at night normally. 
On the floor , she was seen by pulmonary consult about management of her obesity ventilation syndrome. 
The patient also had a known stage IV decubitus in her sacral area that did not appear to be infected. 
Typical doses were 40 mg IV and at the time of discharge the patient could comfortably lie flat on her back without any discomfort. 
An echocardiogram was checked which showed normal EF moderate right ventricular dysfunction and no wall motion abnormalities. 
This did not demonstrate any change from prior. 
She was seen by surgery and GYN who evaluated her and looked at her abdominal CT and felt that this was not a clinically significant fistula and was not in fact a source of infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Aortic stenosis , COPD , cough , diabetes , history of DVT , hypertension , GERD. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease , COPD , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , and ischemic cardiomyopathy presenting as a transfer from Osri Medical Center for management of ischemic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. 
Concurrently , he was treated with a course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for presumed bronchitis. 
The next step intended was for a cardiac catheterization , but there was concern regarding his aortic stenosis which despite a gradient of only 14% on echocardiogram , was concerning , as this might represent an underestimation. 
He was transferred to Pagham University Of for further evaluation of both the need for aortic valve replacement and this new reduced ejection fraction , felt to likely be ischemic cardiomyopathy , with a demand related non-ST-elevation MI. 
At this time , he denies any chest pain or chest heaviness now or prior to admission. 
He has no back or jaw pain.

His abdomen was obese , large , soft , nondistended and nontender , with positive bowel sounds. 
His extremities had chronic venous stasis changes of right and lower extremities with areas of no skin breakdown. 
His UA was significant for 3+ protein , trace glucose , negative ketones , 3+ leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4-10 red blood cells , 4+ bacteria , and 3+ triple phosphate crystals. 
Abdominal and chest CT showed bibasilar airspace opacities , left greater than right , with aspiration versus pneumonia , bilateral hydronephrosis , severe decubitus ulcers , and large gastrohepatic lymph nodes slightly enlarged and calcified. 
BiPAP was used at night as he had used at home for a sleep apnea with O2 saturations in the high 90's on room air during the day. 
Levofloxacin was started for this and for the presumed pneumonia seen on chest x-ray for a total of a 10-day course. 
Sputum and blood cultures have been no growth to date. 
He had no fevers and no elevated white counts. 
3. Cardiac: He was thought to have an element of autonomic insufficiency secondary to sarcoid with episodes of hypo and hypertension in the MICU. 
His cortisol stim test was within normal limits , it was 14.5 before stim and 23.6 after stim , so he was not treated with steroids. 
He continued to have ectopy and continued to be hypertensive , and given his diabetes , he was started on a low dose of captopril on 6/20/2006 with no complications and was able to maintain blood pressures in ideal ranges. 
6. Decubitus ulcer: Plastic Surgery was consulted on 4/29/2006 and the wound did not look infected. 
The risks and benefits of eating were explained to his wife and him and he decided to continue to eat as there was no ideal option. 
Extremities , he had 2+ peripheral edema that was stable with no skin breakdown. 
He will need continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring given the new beta-blocker and the ACE inhibitor as well as assessment of his frequent PVCs. 
We will continue to follow his diabetes and continue to follow his INR with a goal being 2 to 3 with ideal goal on the higher end 8 range.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Transfer from outside hospital for decompensated heart failure and hyponatremia. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old female with nonischemic cardiomyopathy , diabetes , obesity with ICD/biventricular pacer , CHF with EF of 15% was admitted to an outside hospital initially for a fall and was subsequently found to have decompensated heart failure and hyponatremia. 
At the time of the fall , the patient was not presyncopal , likely due to possibly feeling weak. 
The patient denies any history of chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitations , however , the patient knows that he has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and weakness. 
EKG: V paced , sinus rhythm , no ischemic changes. 
Chest x-ray: Pleural effusions bilaterally , no infiltrates , CHF. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65-year-old female with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy , CHF with EF of 15% and on a biventricular pacer , ICD , diabetes , obesity , admitted from outside hospital for treatment of hyponatremia and decompensated heart failure. 
1. Cardiovascular: A. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensated heart failure. 
A beta-blocker was also added , specifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg once daily was also added to the regimen. 
In terms of diuresis initially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and at one point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was not responding to diuretics. 
As a result , there was consideration and discussion about mitral valve replacement. 
This will be a percutaneous procedure possibly. 
B. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. 
As a result , although not urgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer was replaced by Dr. Dominguez on 4/20/05. 
The patient tolerated the procedure very well with no complications. 
C. Ischemia: There are no active issues. 
EKGs demonstrated no signs of cardiac ischemia. 
3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. 
ID: The patient's UA demonstrated possible evidence for urinary tract infection. 
This may also have contributed to patient's decompensated heart failure and also initial complaints of feeling weak. 
Vital signs were stable with no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughout hospitalization.

RECORD #660
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSES: Morbid obesity , hypothyroidism , hypertension , history of poor adherence to medical regimen. 
The patient denies chest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sore throat and a cough for approximately one week. 
The patient reports compliance with most of her medicines but states that she is not taking Synthroid and lisinopril because these medications make her feel bad. 
She does not measure her daily weights. 
note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of 200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuff size. 
In general , the patient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowly responsive to questions with frequent staring episodes. 
HEENT exam was significant for mild pharyngeal erythema without exudates. 
Neck exam was significant for no lymphadenopathy. 
Abdomen was morbidly obese but did have active bowel sounds and was nontender. 
Extremities showed significant subcutaneous fatty tissue , however , there was no pitting edema. 
There was a question of slow relaxation phase. 
INITIAL IMPRESSION: This is a 58-year-old woman with morbid obesity , dilated cardiomyopathy and hypothyroidism in the setting of poor medical compliance , admitted with likely multifactorial dyspnea on exertion and mild congestive heart failure and decompensation. 
There were no significant events on telemetry during this hospitalization. 
Ischemia: Rule out MI protocol was initiated in the ED secondary to vague symptoms. 
However , secondary to difficulty with blood draws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtained on this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in the near future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking her thyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functional status in addition to her cardiomyopathy.

She denied any chest pain or syncope with these episodes. 
She was admitted to the cardiology service for further evaluation. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) in April , 1995. 
2. Type 2 diabetes which is complicated by peripheral neuropathy. 
4. Gout. 5. Anxiety and depression. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Pravachol 10 mg p.o.q.d.; Elavil 20 mg p.o. once a day; allopurinol 3 x week; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day; Accupril 10 mg once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a day; Xanax t.i.d. p.r.n.

She denies any alcohol use. 
She lives alone on the Tonpaulhunt Hamp Geaus but has a daughter who lives in Orl Rocheda Saltprocra PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 104 , blood pressure 100/60 , satting 96% on room air , breathing 18. GENERAL: She is in no acute distress. 
Her chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate. 
1 ) Cardiovascular - Ischemia: The patient's abnormal rhythm was presumed to be ventricular tachycardia given her history of severe ischemic heart disease. 
She did not have any complaints of chest pain during the hospitalization. 
We continued her on her beta blocker and initially held her digoxin while we were controlling her rhythm. 
Pump: At the time of admission the patient was classified as having Class II heart failure although she did admit to not being very active and it was felt that if the patient exerted herself more she would have more symptoms. 
She did not exhibit any signs of volume overload during her hospitalization and we continued her home dose of Lasix. 
She denied any chest pain. 
Her VTAC was thought to be primarily due to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discussed the need for an ICD with her. 
We did also discuss the possibility of an EP study and ablation but the patient preferred the least invasive method possible. 
While the patient was currently in compensated heart failure , as mentioned previously it was felt that this was because she did not exert herself any further , and that it was likely that she would within the next year or two , decompensate and have more symptoms of congestive heart failure. 
She did not have any more episodes of VTAC. 2 ) Endocrinology: We kept the patient on her same insulin regimen of 60 units in the morning and in the evening and covered her with an insulin sliding scale. 
At baseline she did not have any pulmonary complaints. 
We did not want to use levofloxacin because of the potential to prolong her QT given that she was taking amiodarone and Elavil. 
We were not able to find out any more details on this reaction. 
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient has a history of gout. 
We continued her allopurinol. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pravachol 10 mg p.o. once a day; Elavil 20 mg p.o.q.d.; NPH 60 mg q. a.m. and q. p.m.; allopurinol 300 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday; Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day; Accupril 10 mg once a day; digoxin 0.0625 once a day; amiodarone 200 mg twice a day; Keflex 250 mg p.o. x 2 doses; cefpodoxime 100 mg p.o.q.d. x 2 days.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. 
She presented with chest pain in 2001 and had a troponin I , which peaked at 25. Cardiac catheterization revealed a left-sided occlusion and percutaneous coronary intervention was unsuccessful. 
A subsequent adenosine mibi in September 2002 revealed normal left ventricular function and no perfusion defects. 
The patient has since been admitted for left chest pain , last in February 2005 , which has been attributed to her shoulder arthritis. 
She did not have any loss of consciousness and also denied chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations.

The patient denies any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehicle collision. 
He also denies any fevers , chills , night sweats , shortness of breath , headaches or visual changes either before or after. 
He had no recent changes in any doses of his medications. 
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies. 
The oropharynx is significant for a slight bite mark on the tongue , without any active bleeding. 
The neck is supple , and there is no midline tenderness. 
There is no bony tenderness along any of the long bones of the upper or lower extremities , with exception of the knee. 
There is no dysmetria or dysarthria. 
There is no drift. 
There was also some supraclavicular stranding along the left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. 
He was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without any diverticulitis. 
The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines also demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally noted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. 
He also had an additional Zoll pacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside , however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic with his bifascicular block. 
He had serial enzymes , which were performed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
He went to the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery disease. 
The diffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any abnormality. 
Therefore , given the fact that signal was seen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was felt that this was at least 10 days old. 
Therefore , this was not felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle collision. 
It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was not previously detected. 
Given the fact that the patient remained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and radiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10 days old , and this was not further addressed. 
The MRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left bifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis. 
The right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis , however , could not be completed excluded. 
There was no evidence of fracture. 
With the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute intervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports Medicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. 
In addition , he was noted to have several rib fractures. 
However , he adamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon inspiring. 
4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute infection. 
Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the last two days of admission. 
The chest x-ray was performed on the 25th , which demonstrated no infiltrate. 
However , further workup for his white count is not performed at the present time , however , the patient is informed , as the Ni Medical Center and the discharge summary , which show that the patient seem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be reevaluated by a physician. 
5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any difficulty. 
He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet. 
However , it was noted that he started having increasing white count. 
The knee was obviously a concern for possible infection. 
An arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry tap; no fluid was able to be obtained. 
The EP Service again evaluated the patient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear infection from the pacer site. 
He continued to have no erythema or tenderness around the pacer site. 
Of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on the Ancef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into the approximately 10000 range.

PROCEDURES: 1. 6/28/2006 , aortogram bilateral lower extremity runoff Dr. Burghard 2. 9/22/2006 left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass graft , Dr. Seefried HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old former smoker with hypertension , diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , CAD status post coronary catheterization in October 2006 and October 2006 who presented in clinic with progressively worsening bilateral foot pain , foot mottling and new ulcerations. 
Concern for atheroembolization was raised following cardiac catheterization. 
At the time of admission , she denied chest pain , shortness of breath or fever , chills. 
c. Status post catheterization 8/6/2006 with left circumflex and right coronary artery disease , noncritical. 
She was noted to have a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. 
Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasic dopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showed bilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration at the base of the left fourth toe. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath was admitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vascular disease which was suspected to be contributing to her new ulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as an exacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , status post coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. 
After extensive discussions with the patient and the patient's family , the patient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass graft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication. 
Please see the operative note for further details. 
The pain was well controlled with minimal analgesics that were not narcotic based. 
Her primary cardiologist , Dr. Katcsmorak did make some recommendations including an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities. 
She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without undue difficulty. 
The patient should not keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at a time. 
2. Legs are to be elevated as much as possible while sitting or lying down. 
5. Showering only , no bathing or immersion in water for prolonged periods of time. 
Do not take with lightheadedness or dizziness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Biddleman is a 63-year-old man with a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and chronic neck and shoulder pain who presented with a near syncopal episode and a new left bundle branch block on EKG. 
He has a history of intermittent episodes of sudden onset of an ill defined , non-painful sensation that shoots from the region of his left shoulder , up his left neck , and then across his head bilaterally. 
He does not know how often he has them , but does not think that he has had more of these episodes recently. 
X-rays have shown degenerative arthritis in the cervical spine , especially in the region of C6 and C7 with evidence of foraminal narrowing and nerve root impingement. 
He did feel nauseated , but did not vomit. 
He denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations. 
This has not changed recently and seems stable. 
He denied any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or swelling of lower extremities. 
His cardiac risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a positive family history , hypercholesterolemia , and he is a former smoker. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 1992 , last glycosylated hemoglobin was was 12.7 in 6/18 2. Possible coronary artery disease , last exercise tolerance test in 6/10 was without any evidence of EKG changes. 
6. History of headaches , possible migraine headache versus cluster headaches. 
7. Probable gastroesophageal reflux disease by history. 
There is no family history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. 
Oropharynx was without any evidence of lesions or without any adenopathy or masses. 
There was no jugular venous distention apparent and no bruits heard. 
His heart sounds were distant with an indistinct first heart sound , but a second heart sound without evidence of splitting. 
There was a question of a fourth heart sound. 
There was also question of a grade I/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. 
His abdomen appeared obese with active bowel sounds. 
He did not have any splenomegaly. 
Extremities were without any evidence of cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
His skin was warm and moist without any lesions. 
A chest x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe opacity and bilateral pleural thickening , no acute infiltrate , and no evidence of congestive heart failure. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The etiology of his symptoms was unclear , but he was admitted to rule out myocardial infarction , given the fact that he had a left bundle branch block pattern on his EKG that was new compared to a previous EKG. 
He was started on heparin for the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. 
He was maintained on aspirin and started on a beta blocker. 
He was started on simvastatin given his hypercholesterolemia. 
He ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes. 
There was no evidence of high grade ventricular ectopy. 
Because he remained asymptomatic , and because his exercise test was without evidence of large areas of myocardium at risk , he was discharged home on 3/2/96.

RECORD #669
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old Mexican male with a history of coronary artery disease , who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting and presented with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the back and arm occurring 7 hours previously. 
The patient's history of c coronary artery disease began in 20 of June , when he developed substernal chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization showing a 100% right coronary artery occlusion and 80% left anterior descending occlusion , 70% proximal mid-left anterior descending lesion. 
In 1 of January , the patient underwent a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Golebiowski at Pagham University Of with a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending and right internal mammary artery graft to the posterior descending artery. 
However , the patient had persistent incisional-type pain after his coronary artery bypass grafting , but reported absence of his angina pain post-CABG. 
The patient underwent an echocardiogram post-CABG showing normal left ventricular function with no regional wall motion abnormalities , moderate effusion and mild left atrial enlargement 4.8 centimeters. 
The patient did well for 2 years post-CABG and underwent an exercise tolerance test in 15 of September , exercising for 10 minutes and 0 seconds , maximum blood pressure 170/100 , without chest pain or electrocardiogram changes , considered to be a negative test. 
Since then , the patient has only had sharp incisional pain not related to exertion , and he suffers no exertional angina and has no exercise limitation. 
The patient had been tried on multiple medications as an outpatient , however , because of issues of noncompliance/alternative belief system , it was unclear as to what medications the patient was actually taking. 
The patient had no nausea , vomiting or shortness of breath , but did suffer pleuritic pain in addition. 
At the Pagham University Of emergency room , the patient had worsening of the severity of his pain and was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin without relief , then morphine sulfate 4 milligrams times 2 , Lopressor 5 milligrams times 1 , Nitro-Paste 1 inch with complete relief. 
An electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm , rate 80 , axis normal , no ST or T-wave abnormalities , no Q-waves. 
The patient was admitted to the Ano Sonprai Rotonards Team. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was notable for albinism , he denies ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeds , he has a history of gout. 
HABITS included former heavy alcohol use , however , he denies use in the last 6 months. 
ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. 
His Carna Home Hospital prescription also included Lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth per day , and Isordil 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times , but the patient denied taking these. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was mildly diaphoretic in no apparent distress. 
Carotids were II+ bilaterally , there was a sternotomy scar on the chest , no evidence of infection. 
Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion without rales. 
Cardiac examination showed a soft S2 , S1 was normal , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Abdomen was soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Rectal examination showed normal tone , normal prostate , guaiac negative. 
Femoral pulses were I+ bilaterally without bruits. 
Extremities showed II+ pulses in the dorsalis pedis , no edema , the deep tendon reflexes were normal. 
Neurologic examination was nonfocal. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray showed clear lungs and no pneumonia or congestive heart failure. 
The electrocardiogram was as noted above. 
Sodium was 141 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 112 , bicarbonate 24 , blood urea nitrogen 26 , creatinine 1.8 , of note his baseline is 1.4 in 5-90 , glucose 85 , white blood cell count 3.59 , platelets 125 , 000 , hematocrit 44.5 , prothrombin time 12.7 , partial thromboplastin time 33.9 , creatinine kinase 1 , 010 with 20 myocardial bands , LDH 222. 
Urinalysis was notable for 4+ proteinuria , no white cells , no red cells , 1 to 2 hyaline casts. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The initial impression was the patient had probable coronary disease and probable unstable angina. 
He was admitted for intensive cardiac monitoring and cardiac catheterization. 
On the first day of admission , the patient suffered 2 episodes of substernal chest pain and he was taken somewhat emergently to cardiac catheterization which revealed a patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , a patent right internal mammary artery graft except for small vessel disease in the graft , and an essentially occluded posterior descending artery. 
However , the patient suffered 2 episodes of substernal chest pain despite being on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin was initiated and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit. 
The patient remained pain-free until he underwent angioplasty of the right coronary artery lesions with a result of 20% residual stenosis. 
Of note , the patient's creatinine kinase levels continued to trend downward with the initial creatinine kinase being 1 , 010 being his maximal value. 
The patient had no further chest pain after his angioplasty , except for the baseline incisional pain which was unrelated to exertion. 
Nitroglycerin was tapered off and the patient was discharged on 9 of January Of note , the 4+ proteinuria was unresolved at the time of discharge , because of his unstable course and transfers between the Intensive Care Unit and the floor , we were unable to complete a 24-hour urine collection. 
The patient will FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Rufus Bernas in the Healtship Ron Offa Memorial Medical Center Estimated disability is none.

She had a cardiac catheterization which showed a 90% left anterior descending , 75% first diagonal , 75% second diagonal. 
The cardiac catheterization was complicated by foot cellulitis , sepsis and deep vein thrombosis and she was in and out of the hospital for several months recovering. 
Her anginal pattern has not changed recently in a significant manner , but over the last several months her pain has been extremely limiting to her activities , and thus she presented for cardiac catheterization and a question of revascularization. 
The patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
Her chest pain is not associated with diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , radiation , or syncope. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for coronary artery disease as above , diabetes times 20 years on insulin for the last 10 years , complicated by neuropathy and retinopathy , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , breast cancer status post left mastectomy and radiation therapy in 1979 , peripheral vascular disease , musculoskeletal pain syndrome , she had a positive ANA previously on work-up , but her symptoms are fluctuant and easily controlled. 
History also included deep vein thrombosis during her previous cardiac catheterization , cataracts , status post cholecystectomy and appendectomy. 
FAMILY HISTORY was negative for coronary artery disease and diabetes. 
ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient lives with her daughter in Lan , she does not smoke nor drink. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was in no apparent distress. 
Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur , no S3 , no S4 , no jugular venous distension. 
Abdominal examination was nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , normoactive bowel sounds , no masses. 
Extremities showed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or effusions. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a 90% proximal left anterior descending stenosis , 70% mid-left anterior descending , 90% first diagonal , 70% second diagonal and 100% obtuse marginal branch stenosis. 
The right coronary artery was not cannulated , but looked normal with what dye could be injected. 
A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was planned the following day for dilatation of her serial left anterior descending lesions , however , the patient had significant bleeding the night before , when arising after her cardiac catheterization and the decision was made to wait until over the weekend to do the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. 
On Monday , the patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with successful dilatation of the serial left anterior descending lesions , both down to 30% , and did well.

PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CARDIOMYOPATHY. 2 ) STATUS POST MULTIPLE INJURIES. 3 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS B. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42 year-old gentleman with dilated cardiomyopathy with worsening functional status. 
His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy. 
There was no thrombus seen. 
There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this year. 
His Lasix dose was increased and his Atenolol dose was decreased. 
His Atenolol was increased. 
He has nocturnal shortness of breath and dyspnea. 
There is no syncope. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for orthopnea as well as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea four out of seven nights. 
There is no nocturia. 
He complains of nausea and anorexia without vomiting. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cardiomyopathy as above , gunshot wound to his chest and head at the age of 14 and motor vehicle accident , Hepatitis B. He has had four colonoscopies in the past and has had no polyps. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 ) Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
His family history is otherwise notable for familial colon cancer and polyposis. 
HEENT is normocephalic , atraumatic. 
Oropharynx revealed multiple fillings , but there is no abnormality. 
His neck is supple with no thyromegaly , carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. 
His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. 
His abdomen was soft , non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. 
He had no bruits. 
There are no masses. 
Neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry , but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal. 
LABORATORY: Laboratory evaluation on admission was notable for a sodium of 133 , creatinine 1.2. 
Liver function tests are notable for a bilirubin of 1.7 and 0.7. 
There was an increase in left atrial size since October of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy now presented with worsening functional status over the past few months as well as recent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. 
There was a question of patient non-compliance especially given his current alcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness for cardiac transplant at this time. 
Following admission , the patient underwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated right atrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , PA pressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure at the time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. Additionally , by Fick , his cardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonary venous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330. 
Because of this markedly high SVR and a borderline PVR , he was started on intravenous nitrates with intravenous Nitroprusside with a significant decrease in his SVR as well as his PA pressures. 
This was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressures to suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate. 
Additionally , he was started on Losartan for further afterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostatic symptoms. 
His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued to have quite a significant improvement symptomatically with no further orthopnea in the hospital. 
There was no reaction to either PPDs or controls at 72 hours. 
He had a B12 and folate level drawn which were within normal limits. 
His thyroid function test demonstrated a TSH of 1.9 and all other parameters were within normal limits. 
Pulmonary function tests were as noted above. 
He was seen by Dental Consult and was felt to have a few minor restorative needs which could be taken care of by his outpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for a transplant. 
There was evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggesting a clot.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Congestive heart failure. 
9. Mild pulmonary hypertension. 
He has a history of coronary artery disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) , hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. 
He is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea , and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent. 
The patient had these worsening heart failure symptoms after a trip to Tempe Leah Cu , some dietary indiscretion and a five-pound weight gain. 
He has had no syncope , palpitations , but has had some mild nausea without emesis. 
He was transferred to Pagham University Of , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. 
He had no dullness. 
He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. 
He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. 
The patient has an extensive history of coronary artery disease. 
He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin. 
He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as demand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. 
His enzymes trended down and were negative after the initial check. 
He was maintained on optimum medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization in this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load was not warranted nor indicated at this time. 
On an outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. 
The patient's heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol , Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic improvement. 
His electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker. 
The patient is not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his QRS interval is greater than 150 ms. 4. Pulmonary. 
He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. 
A more likely explanation for these findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate diuresis with his congestive heart failure. 
The patient has very difficult to control diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro sliding scale while in house. 
The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. 
He has had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a creatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast dye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal insufficiency. 
He was making good urine and had no evidence of residual urinary tract infection. 
The patient has a history of depression and had some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection , which resolved with p.r.n. 
Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt like he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this time. 
( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed to his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of this age is not uncommon. 
He should have low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat as well as a diabetic diet with ADA 2100 calories per day. 
2. Consider outpatient trial of ACE inhibitor or ARB in the future with close monitoring of potassium.

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION 8. OBESITY 9. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA PROCEDURES: SEE HOSPITAL COURSE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old gentleman with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus , obesity , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting and pacemaker placement in 1996 and 1999 respectively , who presented on 7/16/2000 with a four day history of cough , fevers , chills , myalgias and left eye pain. 
He had been experiencing nausea and vomiting without diarrhea and fevers to 103 degrees. 
NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy , no carotid bruits and no jugular venous distention. 
S3 , loud S2. EXTREMITIES: Minimal edema , no cyanosis. 
CT of the head showed no evidence of acute bleed. 
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on the day of admission and did not demonstrate any vegetation , however with persistent high spiking fevers , sepsis and 4/4 blood culture bottles , repeated blood cultures growing GBS the patient had repeat transesophageal echocardiogram. 
This demonstrated a 1.5x1.0 centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspid valve and it was also noted to be hitting the pacemaker wire though not fixed to it. 
Of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogram was negative for patent foramen ovale. 
This was treated with a ten day course of dicloxacillin and resolved without complications. 
An extensive work up was undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation for possible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints. 
The patient underwent multiple joint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clear evidence of infection. 
These were interpreted both on the initial views and delayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but not diagnostic of infection. 
The patient's fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay and on the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was no myocardial abscess. 
There was no evidence of any abscess and the vegetation was no longer visible. 
It was felt that the low grade fevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute infectious process at the time of discharge. 
It was felt from the time of presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left eye. 
The patient's eye healed well through the remainder of his hospital course and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter. 
By 6/24/2000 the pacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing. 
As mentioned above , the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation noted on the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetation was hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole. 
On 6/13/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without complications. 
There was some concern throughout the patient's hospital course that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in place however this never manifested as a problem. 
His Lopressor was increased in response to this and the patient was tolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia or hypotension. 
he did rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission. 
There were no bacteria on gram stain or culture. 
There were no complications. 
It was determined that the patient should not have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warm or erythematous. 
It was not felt that there was enough manipulation to skeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this. 
At the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias or arthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is still somewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates an effusion but is responding well to rehabilitation. 
The patient does have obstructive sleep apnea and used his BIPAP at night throughout his hospitalization. 
9. Endocrine: The patient has a long standing history of type II diabetes mellitus. 
On admission , he was taking metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. , regular insulin 10 q a.m. and 10 q p.m. , NPH insulin 25 q a.m. and 20 q p.m. His hemoglobin A1-C was noted to be elevated at 8.1 in 11/15 The patient's metformin was held throughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possible invasive procedures.

2. History of questionable inflammatory bowel disease. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 41-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis and questionable inflammatory bowel disease with a known colonic stricture since 4/5 The patient has had attempted to dilatation without success. 
Her past medical history is significant for diverticulitis , questionable inflammatory bowel disease , GERD , depression , chronic pain , and history of breast cancer. 
The night of postoperative day #1 , as mentioned earlier , the patient was increasingly agitated before she was transferred to the unit and although discontinued her NG tube it was thought at this time that she may have aspirated. 
A PE protocol CT was obtained that was negative for emboli or DVT but was positive for right upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that was consistent with an aspiration event. 
Of note , the CT also did not reveal any evidence of acute bleed; however , this was a noncontrast study. 
On postoperative day #3 , the patient in the unit with hypertension , anemia , tachycardia , the patient's hematocrit was still 23 and she received 2 additional units of red blood cells and hematocrit rose to 30 at this time. 
She continued to be agitated and there was a question raised then that there was an unclear history that was not previously diagnosed of alcoholism and this may have been an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon. 
So , her Versed actually was increased then for a questionable alcohol withdrawal and she was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate and in addition for her hypertension Lopressor 5 q.4 was continued. 
Psych was consulted on postoperative day #5 and concluded that this woman had a history of polysubstance abuse , alcohol and likely opiates , and chronic abdominal pain due to stricture which probably was related to her opioid abuse; I believe the delirium was likely multifactorial in etiology , postoperative delirium that was notable for significant fluid shifts , there was the question of aspiration pneumonia in addition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal. 
Patient goal was to wean off sedation for a possible extubation. 
The ureteral injury believed to be resolved at this point , continued on her levo and Flagyl with question of whether or not to stop her antibiotic regimen. 
Her diet over the last couple of days had been advanced without any problems and she was converted to a house diet on postoperative day #10. 
The wound was explored and there was found to be no fascial defect. 
The Medicine Team also strongly enforced , reminded her not to drink while taking the Ativan.

The abdomen was protuberant , soft , and non-tender. 
There was no evidence of cellulitis with a necrotic left fourth toe. 
That was tolerated well , but did not seem to be viable secondary to ischemia and infection. 
Intraoperatively , the bone did not seem to be involved and , at this point , we had been continuing wet-to-dry dressing changes and , as of January , 2002 , the plan was to take the patient to the operating room on January , 2002 for another skin graft. 
For her depression , she receives Prozac.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Pre-gestational diabetes. 
2. History of coronary artery disease. 
3. Recurrent SABs 4. Hepatitis B. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old G16 , P0-0-15-0 , who presented at 6 and 4/7 weeks by LMP consistent with ultrasound of the day of admission , as a transfer from the High-Risk Obstetric Clinic , admitted to the Fuller Antepartum Service for diabetic control. 
In view of this and in view of the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , the patient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of her insulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medical problems. 
The infarct was a presumed embolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronary artery. 
In addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000. 
The patient had been evaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this had been negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation , which was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether this has been addressed previously. 
The patient had previously been told by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consider adoption or a gestational carrier. 
The patient currently denies a history of sexually transmitted infections. 
For this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan , then VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure. 
Father with coronary artery disease in his 50s. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primary purpose of diabetic control. 
The patient had reported poor diabetic control as an outpatient. 
This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well as a large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be a longstanding. 
Therefore , their recommendation was to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of this pregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mg daily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to be continued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. 
The Cardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had not resulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. 
During the entire admission , she was hemodynamically stable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain , shortness of breath or palpitations. 
On admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had been stopped prior to this current pregnancy. 
It was decided that the patient should not take any lamivudine until Gastroenterology followup. 
During the entire hospital stay , the patient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regular diet , and having normal regular bowel movements. 
4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroid on her ultrasound scan. 
She required rare intermittent doses of oxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be related to her fibroid uterus. 
In view of the patient's diabetic history , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospital day 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , the patient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returned negative at 92 mg per 24 hours. 
It was noted that the patient had an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital health center this year. 
For the remainder of this pregnancy , it was noted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17 weeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing for pre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy. 
DISPOSITION: Home without services.

At that time , the patient was presumed to have a viral syndrome. 
The patient has noted no change in her usual bowel habits of one stool per week. 
She has had no diarrhea , constipation , melena , or hematochezia. 
She has had no hematemesis. 
She denies any urinary symptoms but only has nocturia. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetes mellitus diagnosed two years ago , obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , nephrolithiasis , osteoarthritis , glaucoma. 
She denies any use of alcohol or tobacco. 
Normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs. 
The urinalysis was notable for pH 5.5 , protein 1+ , glucose 1+ , leukocytes 1+ , nitrite positive , trace ketones , and no blood. 
The biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. 
However , the patient did not have any of the associated risk factors , given that the patient is not sexually active and denied introducing any foreign objects into the vagina. 
Since a CT scan is not the optimal test to evaluate the adnexa , a transvaginal ultrasound was ordered which revealed endometrial thickness of 3.6 mm and bilateral cystic masses. 
The patient's right upper quadrant pain and tenderness persisted for several days during the admission with periodic exacerbations and was increasingly suspicious for cholelithiasis or pancreatitis. 
The patient then had an abdominal ultrasound which was essentially was within normal limits and showed no abnormal viscera. 
The bilateral adnexal masses continued to be of major concern , and interventional radiology was consulted for possible aspiration. 
The biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. 
The patient had a repeat CT scan on hospital day number seven which was essentially unchanged from admission showing persistent bilateral adnexal masses and no free fluid. 
The symptoms were suggestive of volume overload and possibly congestive heart failure. 
A chest x-ray was notable for bilateral atelectasis in the lower lobes but no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. 
By discharge , the patient was without pain. 
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home and required no services.

RECORD #738
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease , who was transferred to I Warho Hospital two days following an acute myocardial infarction , for post myocardial infarction management. 
The patient has known coronary artery disease , and is status post myocardial infarction in 1998. 
At this time he underwent a two-vessel CABG with a saphenous vein graft to the RCA and to the LAD. 
He underwent an exercise treadmill test in 1997 , that showed inferolateral ST depressions with exercise , that were considered non-diagnostic , secondary to LVH and some resting EKG abnormalities. 
On August , the patient noted 10 out of 10 chest pain while walking with his family. 
He took sublingual nitroglycerin times three with no relief. 
He was taken to Thasstoncheripigapema Memorial Hospital where an EKG showed ST depressions in leads V2 through V4 , and T wave flattening in V1 and V5. He also had T wave inversions in V2 through V4. 
The patient was treated with intravenous heparin , intravenous nitroglycerin , and beta blockers. 
He eventually developed a Q wave in V1. During his hospitalization at Mery Hospital , the patient was noted to have an 11 beat run of V-tach on August , and was started on a lidocaine drip. 
The lidocaine drip was stopped on September , and the intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned. 
He was placed on nitro paste on September , and his intravenous heparin was then stopped on January . 
He denies having any chest pain since his initial pain on the seventh. 
He also denies shortness of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , swelling , nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. 
2. Exercise induced atrial fibrillation noted in 1990 with no recurrence. 
3. Prostate carcinoma status post prostatectomy in 1986. 
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , nitro paste started at the outside hospital. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
He denies any use of tobacco or alcohol. 
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: No tobacco , no hypertension , no family history of significant cardiac disease , and no known history of hypercholesterolemia. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant elderly man in no acute distress , who was sitting up in bed. 
The neck was supple with jugular venous pressure noted , approximately 8 centimeters. 
The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales or wheezes. 
The coronary exam showed regular rate and rhythm , with a 1/6 midsystolic murmur at the left sternal border , and no S3. 
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly were noted. 
The extremity exam showed no edema , with 2+ femoral and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. 
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , with normal intervals. 
The prior ST depressions had resolved , and there were Q waves in V1 and V2. 
The T waves were flattened in V5 and V6. HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac: the patient remained off of his heparin drip and on his nitro paste , and had no further episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. 
There were no valvular abnormalities. 
Because the patient had no further episodes of chest pain , he did not undergo further evaluation , and was discharged home. 
The plan is for him to undergo another exercise test in approximately 3 to 4 weeks. 
Blood cultures were drawn and were negative , and a chest x-ray was normal as well. 
On hospital day number three , the patient was noted to have a non-pruritic , non-painful , erythematous rash on the back of his lower right buttock and the back of his right leg. 
The patient claimed that this rash was completely asymptomatic , and he would not know about it if no one had pointed it out. 
On hospital day number four , it was noted that this rash had filled up a dermatomal pattern on the back of his right leg , and it was felt that this most likely represented an acute outbreak of herpes zoster. 
The patient was not treated specifically for herpes , given that he was asymptomatic , and we did not have any proven diagnosis. 
However , we were confident enough of this that we felt that it would explain his low grade temperatures. 
It was therefore felt that he did not need any acute psychiatric evaluation. 
He will be seen by the Visiting Nurses Association , approximately two times a week , to check both his blood pressure and cardiac status , as well to help insure that he is not developing a more severe depression. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The discharge medications include atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 12.5 mg p.o. q. p.m. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. evening , and Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.

RECORD #741
The patient has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension and hyperlipidemia , as well as a past history of a left hemispheric stroke with a right-sided hemiparesis , who awoke the morning of admission with left lip numbness. 
The patient denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. 
Given his history of myocardial infarction that he states may have occurred in the past , as well as numerous coronary risk factors , he was admitted for rule out of myocardial infarction and evaluation of his left-sided numbness. 
( 4 ) Type II diabetes. 
He denies alcohol or tobacco use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin , Hispanic male in no acute distress , and pleasant. 
Neck was supple without adenopathy. 
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , with positive bowel sounds. 
Extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema. 
There was question of a left lower lobe opacity. 
There were no signs of congestive heart failure. 
Head CT without contrast showed an old left centrum semiovale lesion , consistent with with a watershed infarct. 
There was no evidence of acute bleed. 
The patient presented without chest pain , but EKG changes , including .5 mm of ST segment depression in lead I , and 1 mm of ST segment depression in leads II , and V4 through V6. 
The patient also was placed on Holter monitor to attempt to rule out a dysrhythmic etiology of his deficit. 
The patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography while an inpatient , to rule out a vegetative source of emboli , which may have resulted in his change in sensation. 
These events were thought to be entirely non-cardiac in nature , and he was removed from Telemetry. 
The patient's hypertension was managed with Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission , and switched to 30 mg of Nifedipine XL p.o. q.d. as an outpatient. 
In the Emergency Room , the patient received one enteric coated aspirin , and he was not started on intravenous heparinization. 
It was unclear , initially , whether the etiology of this patient's change in neurological status was secondary to embolic phenomena or possibly a second watershed infarct. 
Given his negative echocardiogram of the heart , as well as a negative Holter monitor , it was thought that the etiology of this patient's left-sided facial numbness was not cardiac in nature. 
He was also noted to have risk factors for small vessel disease , including hypertension and diabetes. 
He underwent MRI with and without contrast of the head , three days after the initial event , which demonstrated only right-sided small vessel disease. 
There was no evidence of acute bleed or underlying vascular abnormality. 
Muscle relaxants may be tried as an outpatient if the above stated efforts do not help reduce this patient's pain. 
This patient had no infectious complications while hospitalized. 
The patient has a history of Type II diabetes , on Diabeta. 
COMPLICATIONS: There were no complications during this stay.

These were characterized by emesis followed by loss of consciousness with a question of seizure like activity. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In the Emergency Room he was noted to be somewhat groggy with a brief episode of apparent loss of consciousness with a question of apnea. 
Chest X-ray raised the question of an infiltrate in the left base. 
His course in the MICU was as follows: He ruled out for myocardial infarction , despite an elevated CK. 
At that time , he was hemodynamically stable , except for intermittent hypertension , which was treated with Nifedipine. 
He was switched from Nifedipine to Captopril for treatment of his hypertension and his fever was treated with Cefotetan for presumed aspiration pneumonia. 
One echocardiogram in a series did reveal a regional wall motion abnormality that may have been a function of the pacemaker wire as well. 
He remained afebrile and completed a course of antibiotics for his presumed aspiration pneumonia , although subsequent chest x-rays did not support that diagnosis. 
Intubation was not necessary.

LEG | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 9/2/1999 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 8/27/1999 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old gentleman who has a past medical history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularization procedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in August of 1998. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior to the coronary artery bypass graft. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
Non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: In 1991 he had a coronary artery bypass graft. 
His postoperative course was complicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managed and he has been without recurrence since that time. 
In August of 1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein and left common femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty , as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 and does not use alcohol. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had no chest pain , shortness of breath , or angina since the time of his bypass. 
Just prior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Lashanda Bachmann of Carna Home Hospital cardiology and was cleared from a cardiac standpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he has done well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms since his bypass surgery. 
This went without complications. 
At that time an ECG was done that showed no significant change and , throughout that episode , he had no hemodynamic instability. 
However , the graft was no longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was strongly Dopplerable. 
The anticoagulation is on for keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or stroke reasons.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white male with known cardiac disease , status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 1989 , status post left anterior descending PTCA in 1989 , who was admitted following an episode of post myocardial infarction chest pain from an outside hospital. 
Cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , history of myocardial infarction. 
Cardiac history dates back to 3/21 when the patient experienced substernal chest discomfort and ruled in for non Q wave myocardial infarction. 
A cardiac catheterization showed 95% left anterior descending lesion , left circumflex 70% lesion and diffuse right coronary artery disease. 
A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 30% left anterior descending lesion , 40% circumflex lesion and 80% OMB3 lesion and 50% mid and distal RCA stenoses. 
He had no angina until approximately two days prior to admission when he presented to an outside hospital with substernal chest discomfort. 
The patient had no further chest discomfort during the admission and had a predischarged modified Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test. 
He did have some episodes of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure , however , this resolved with Lasix. 
On 6/9 , he had a modified Bruce protocol stress test for which he went nine minutes without chest discomfort or shortness of breath. 
This was read as evidence of no ischemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient denied any history of tobacco , ethanol , or illicit drug use. 
Apparently , these extremity changes are long-standing and not new. 
CKs were flat and the patient was ruled out for an MI. IMPRESSION: 1. Neurologic: Given the patient's significant cardiac history and subtherapeutic INR , it was considered that her left lower extremity weakness that was transient was likely a transient ischemic attack. 
The patient had several episodes of atypical chest pain , for which she was ruled out with telemetry and enzymes , which were flat. 
3. Endocrine: The patient was placed on a diabetic diet and was continued on her glyburide.

HISTORY: The patient is a 56 year old woman with chronic venous stasis complicated by Psychiatric history , chronic noncompliance , and visits to multiple care providers , readmitted for painful , swollen , red , right lower extremity. 
She denied nausea , vomiting , bright red blood per rectum , melena or chest pain. 
The patient does report chronic abdominal pain , positive dyspnea on exertion , but no dysuria. 
Physical examination reveals a morbidly obese middle aged female in no acute distress. 
A right lower extremity x-ray revealed no bony abnormalities. 
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: From an I.D. standpoint , cellulitis was treated with Ancef without improvement. 
A dermatology consult was obtained on March and gave an impression of cellulitis secondary to venous insufficiency and obesity and possible tinea pedis. 
The consult recommended discontinuing nystatin and triamcinolone with use of Spectazole and miconazole between the toes on lower legs and inframammary b.i.d. 
Debridement was not recommended at that time. 
Dermatology saw the patient on May once more and supported the diagnosis of chronic venous stasis. 
From a hematologic standpoint , the beginning of this day , the patient received lower extremity , noninvasive imaging to rule out deep venous thrombosis. 
From a psychiatric standpoint the patient has an undifferentiated psychiatric disorder , most possibly bipolar with a manic component but refused to see Psych and instead insisted on taking Dexedrine for a claimed diagnosis of narcolepsy. 
The patient lacks any suicidal or homicidal ideation and does not appear to have any psychotic component. 
Given that all of the involved sources believed that the most fundamental cause for the patient's symptoms was fluid overload and venous insufficiency in the lower extremities , aggressive diuresis was continued , leading ultimately to a dose of 80 mg of Lasix b.i.d. 
An echocardiogram on May showed right ventricular dilatation without any compromise in function. 
From a musculoskeletal standpoint the patient did suffer a fall while standing on September She had no head trauma. 
She did complain of some right knee pain without functional impairment. 
There was no instability in the joint. 
However three views from the foot showed no evidence of fracture of significant soft tissue disease. 
At that point only stasis dermatitis continued.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Mira Sickafoose , whose past medical history includes diabetes , hypertension , and multiple prior coronary interventions ( ballooned ) , presents in a stable state for elective coronary artery bypass graft , after a cardiac catheterization showed two vessel disease. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 23 of November the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting , left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to left coronary artery and then to obtuse marginal. 
A new angiogram was performed which showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occluded sequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronary artery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft. 
The patient was reoperated; a new coronary artery bypass graft was performed on 23 of June , a new vein graft was placed to the right posterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal. 
Vascular Surgery was consulted but no further intervention was done. 
3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her surgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. 
Infectious Disease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as the patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said that this was the reason for her redness. 
In the last two days of her stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more visible , and there was some question of increased white blood cells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be continued for about seven more days. 
5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time , a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no obstruction to venous flow. 
The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation and was treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockers , namely Lopressor.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease who was admitted on 2/9/97 for bladder suspension surgery to Akcare Hospital The plan at that time was for a laparoscopic procedure , but because of bladder puncture , it was converted to an open procedure. 
For this reason , she was started on IV TNG and transferred to I Warho Hospital for cardiac catheterization. 
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 1/10/97 and this revealed three vessel disease. 
She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 3/4/97 with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , and SVG to OM1. 
She took three sublingual nitroglycerin at home and had no relief. 
On arrival to the I Warho Hospital on the floor , she had 3 out of 10 chest pain , without shortness of breath , presyncope or palpitations.

EXTREMITIES - Revealed a left lower extremity medial scar with erythema but no pus. 
She had left-sided edema , 2+ to the mid shin , but there was no edema on the right side. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: In short , this was a 72-year-old woman who was status post coronary artery bypass grafting 12 days prior to admission , who was now readmitted within four hours of discharge because of rapid atrial fibrillation and chest pain lasting for an hour. 
Other possible explanations for her chest pain included: Question of pericarditic , post-pericardiotomy pain vs. coronary disease vs non-cardiac causes. 
On hospital day #2 , she had an episode of atrial fibrillation at a rate of 140-150 with symptoms of palpitation but no chest pain. 
On the following day , she had an episode of atypical chest pain without EKG changes and which was different from her prior angina.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension , renal artery stenosis , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , and COPD who presents with 3 days of increasing shortness of breath. 
At baseline , she can usually walk a block before becoming short of breath and over these past few days , she can no longer walk several feet. 
She denies any chest pain , palpitations , or lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , and diaphoresis. 
She has had stable 3-pillow orthopnea for many years with no recent increase in lower extremity edema. 
The patient had been followed recently as an outpatient by both cardiology and renal for her hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. 
An EKG showed ST depressions in leads V2 through V6. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , COPD , anemia , osteoarthritis , gout , peripheral vascular disease , and hypercholesterolemia.

She was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor. 
The patient has no chest pain or shortness of breath since this time up until the time of discharge. 
The patient also has a history of hypertension with known unilateral renal artery stenosis. 
2. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath on admission thought to be a combination of COPD , recent upper respiratory infection with question of a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray as well as volume overload. 
In addition to the patient's ACE inhibitor , Lasix , allopurinol , and colchicine were held prior to cardiac catheterization. 
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. 
This was thought to be a bunion versus the patient's gout. 
Given increased redness , warmth , and swelling the patient was treated for a gout flare. 
She was given colchicine ( renally dosed ) and continued on her prophylactic allopurinol. 
The patient will be continued on renally dose prophylactic allopurinol.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , this is an 85-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , CRI , and prior mitral valve replacement , and bioprosthesis presented with DE compensated heart failure , increasing shortness of breath , and chest pain. 
He has complex cardiovascular history and progressive symptoms of heart failure. 
He had implantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 3/7 His history of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has had more marked decline over the past two years currently has SOB typically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. 
He has been admitted to the Osri Medical Center several times for management of CHF in 1/14 After diuresis he states he could walk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk up steps. 
Echocardiogram at PUO on 5/13 showed EF of 35% , septal and apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitral bioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mild perivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonary hypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferred for evaluation and management of chest pain at Osri Medical Center with ? 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF , EF is 25% , atrial fibrillation , chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 , mild COPD , status post AAA repair in 1995 , BPH , TIA/CVA , anemia , on home O2 , status post AICD , pacer , status post sinus arrest in 1993 , ischemic cardiomyopathy , CAD , status post mitral valve replacement , porcine valve placed in 1980 , and status post CABG x2. Please see HPI for further information. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: NAD , 60s to 70s , afebrile , and BP is 100 to 110 over 50 to 60. Saturating at 89% on two liters , 94% on four liters , JVD 12 , mild HJR , bronchial breath sounds , dullness at bases , and no rales. 
Extremities are warm without edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Cardiovascular: An 84-year-old man with complex medical issues elderly and debilitated currently with last three to four heart failures secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
For this reason , it was discussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve as he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his end-stage heart and generally frail state. 
Plan as of the time of this dictation is to undergo TEE on 2/18/05 to evaluate whether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then to have mitral valve clamping later this week. 
Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary to mitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baseline unknown. 
CODE: Code status was changed during the time of this admission to DNR/DNI/no pressors.

2. Chronic venous stasis. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old female with a history of hypertension , diabetes , obesity , as well as a schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , presents with right knee swelling , redness and pain for one week. 
She denies trauma to the area recently. 
She also denies fevers , chills , shortness of breath or chest pain. 
There is no nausea , vomiting , constipation or diarrhea. 
She smokes tobacco , but denies ethanol. 
In general , this is an obese female , she is thai-speaking mostly. 
She is no acute distress. 
Abdomen was distended and obese. 
There are positive bowel sounds , and no palpable liver and spleen. 
On the right ankle area , there appears to be chronic venous stasis changes with hyperpigmented patch on the lower extremity. 
There are less chronic venous stasis changes on the left lower extremity. 
Her right knee film showed mild effusion , no fracture. 
There were no crystals seen. 
There were no organisms seen. 
ASSESSMENT: Ms. Fausett is a 50-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension , and diabetes , was admitted for one week of worsening right knee redness , swelling and pain causing immobility. 
Infectious causes were considered less likely given the fact that the patient's white count was not significantly elevated , ( it was 10.5 with 75% polys , and 80% lymphs ) , and in fact that she has not had any fever. 
The patient was treated empirically , however , as this diagnosis was unable to be ruled out initially with vancomycin and Unasyn and then with levofloxacin. 
This continued until lower extremity Doppler studies showed no deep venous thrombosis in the right femoral or left popliteal veins. 
These values suggest that gout may be involved in this problem , however , there are no crystals and the synovial fluid making this diagnosis also less likely. 
While in the hospital , she received Physical Therapy who evaluated the patient and suggested that the patient would benefit from continued direct physical therapy to address functional mobility retraining. 
A psych consult was obtained to address the question of when and how to restart the lithium. 
The psych consultant suggested to check lithium levels daily until they fell below 0.5 and then should restart the lithium at 300 mg at bedtime. 
Her beta-blocker was held as well as her lithium and her heart rate improved to the 50 and 60s. 
We would recommend holding the beta-blocker until follow up at her primary care physician's office for her next appointment. 
The patient had no chest pain. 
4. Renal: Acute renal failure on presentation with a creatinine of 1.6 and 1.0 is likely prerenal versus lithium toxicity versus a combination of these. 
5. Endocrinology: The patient had a history of diabetes according to her medical records. 
At this time , diabetes may or may not be an appropriate diagnosis for her and she should follow up with her primary care physician with a fasting blood glucose test.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy , hypertension , diabetes type 2 , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who had a reported cardiac arrest while receiving dialysis on 3/25/06 in her outpatient clinic at Des She began to feel nauseated and then vomited. 
She has since received dialysis treatments with no complication. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , CHF , echo in July of 1999 shows moderate left ventricular hypertrophy of about 65% , diabetes type 2 20 years including with retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathic pain , hypertension for the past 20 years , hypercholesterolemia , status post medullary CVA July 1999 , right PICA resulting Wallenberg's syndrome , morbid obesity , left knee degenerative joint disease , iron-deficiency anemia. 
The patient is an obese woman who was intubated and responded to voice. 
Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Extremities showed no edema. 
Distal pulses were not palpable bilaterally. 
Urinalysis was remarkable for 2+ protein , 3+ blood and positive for nitrates , and negative for leuks , 4 to 10 white blood cells , 15 to 25 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , 1+ squamous epithelial cells. 
IMAGING: Significant imaging at admission was an x-ray for chest x-ray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities , possible pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia , an EKG showing normal sinus rhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and old T-wave inversion in V2. ASSESSMENT: This is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes who had an apparent VFib arrest at hemodialysis on 7/8/06 and was shocked and admitted to the CCU after being intubated in the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of ED. 
Whether or not the patient actually had a VFib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had an arrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at 0.14 on 3/25/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shock at hemodialysis. 
Echo on 3/25/06 shows an EF of 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and no wall motion abnormalities. 
The patient was continued on telemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker with good response. 
The patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet with no signs of aspiration status post extubation.

He was in his usual state of health until he developed this shortness of breath while driving which he is believed is secondary to an asthma flare. 
He was transferred to the cardiology service for rule out myocardial infarction and for further evaluation and treatment. 
At that time he denied any chest pain or radiation of pain. 
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Abdomen: Large , obese. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction and he , indeed , was found to rule in for a myocardial infarction with triponin of 7.77. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization on 7/1/98 which revealed stenosis of the left anterior descending artery of 90% and left circumflex artery of 90% and right coronary artery total occlusion. 
Based on these catheterization results and his ruling in for myocardial infarction , he was taken to the operating room on 4/8/98 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft. 
He also remained on a Lasix drip for diuresis and he continued to receive multiple units of blood products. 
Postoperatively he had atrial fibrillation and he was begun on Coumadin. 
The patient was noted to have a 3 cm upper sternal opening which was initially thought to be possibly infected and this was opened as concern for his diabetes mellitus and possible infection. 
Plastic surgery was consulted and there was no gross infection to be found. 
The plastic surgery recommended two week course of IV Vancomycin to cover possible organisms; however , there was no clinical evidence of infection. 
The patient had a PICC line placed for long term antibiotics and he is being discharged on Vancomycin IV at a dose of 1 mg IV q18h with peak and trough to be checked at rehabilitation facility.

A Holter monitor in 4/17 showed frequent premature ventricular contractions , 21 couplets , and no other arrhythmias. 
There were no signs of definite ischemic and no clinically significant rhythm disturbance. 
He denied ever being symptomatic with these arrhythmias. 
The day of admission on his way to the clinic for an INR check , he reported chest tightness that was different from his previous pulmonary emboli , apparently 10/10 on presentation though he denied it after the fact associated with shortness of breath and fatigue with "heavy heart beats". 
He denied associated symptoms of nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , light headedness , and palpitations. 
He denied congestive heart failure and syncopal symptoms over the last few weeks. 
Patient stopped secondary to fatigue and not chest pain , however , three to five minutes after recovery , he developed a couple of episodes of nonmonomorphic wide complex tachycardia at a rate of about 150 lasting twenty to thirty beats during which time he was reportedly asymptomatic. 
The patient was admitted for evaluation of this possible ventricular tachycardia. 
Patient had a negative hypercoagulability work-up , question of renal cell carcinoma which must be evaluated in the next two months , history of PPD positivity of 2 cm and negative chest x-ray , mitral valve prolapse and MR on echo , hypertensive borderline hypercholesterolemia , gout , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , status post unilateral orchiectomy , restrictive lung disease , history of a duplex 5 cm adrenal mass , negative 17 hydroxyketosteroids and VMA , and history of hepatitis A virus.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient immigrated from the Mil with his wife a few years ago , had a remote history of tobacco , occasional alcohol , and no drugs. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 70 year old with a history of hypertensive borderline hypercholesterolemia , and hypercoagulability with multiple pulmonary emboli in the past who presented asymptomatically with a wide complex tachycardia that could not rule out ventricular tachycardia in the recovery phase of a full Bruce exercise tolerance test. 
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
On 10/15/98 , the patient had an exercise tolerance test MIBI on an increased dose of beta blocker of 50 mg of Lopressor q.8h. 
which showed that the patient exercised three minutes and fifteen seconds stopping secondary to leg pain from his deep venous thrombosis with a peak heart rate of 106 , peak blood pressure 150/80 , frequent premature ventricular contractions in couplets , no ST or T wave changes , and no chest pain. 
He did have chest pain after the infusion with T wave inversions in V5 through V6 and occasional premature ventricular contractions that were consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
The MIBI images showed mild nonspecific inferior wall changes with some reversibility suggestive with but not conclusive of ischemia. 
He will continue his beta blocker at an increased dose , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , in addition to his Cardura and amlodipine.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43 year old woman with no significant past medical history who presented with fevers , chills , sweats , shortness of breath , pleuritic chest pain , cough inducing vomiting of white to yellow fluid , myalgias , burning epigastric pain , and diarrhea all over the last five days. 
Clinical diagnosis was apparently flash pulmonary edema as she had a normal admission chest X-Ray which later revealed mild pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure. 
She was well overall until five days ago when she started developing the following symptoms: 1 ) "Bone pain" first in her hands and then all over. 2 ) Fevers ( although she did not take her temperature ). 3 ) Chills. 4 ) Drenching sweats. 
7 ) Pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration and laying on her left side. 8 ) Cough and/or white vomitus ( one apparently induces the other but the patient cannot distinguish which ). 9 ) Nose bleeds. 
She denies hemoptysis , weight loss , photophobia , neck stiffness , runny nose , sneezing , radiation of chest pain , dysuria , lower extremity edema , bright red blood per rectum , or melena. 
It is otherwise significant for one episode of pulmonary edema of unclear etiology as noted above. 
Her exercise tolerance test was significant for not going nine minutes on a standard Bruce protocol with a peak heart rate of 150 stopping secondary to fatigue with blood pressure of 170/80 and no chest pain or ischemic changes. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is separated , lives with three of five children , works as a cleaning lady in various buildings in Ence Na A Chi Valepit , no tobacco , last smoked at the age of 14 , and no alcohol or intravenous drug use. 
HEENT: Remarkable for dry mucous membranes and a white coating over her tongue but no erythema or exudate of her posterior pharynx. 
LUNGS: Remarkable for diffuse crackles scattered throughout both lung fields , louder in the mid and lower lung fields bilaterally , and no egophony or dullness. 
HEART: Remarkable for tachycardia and normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
BACK: Revealed mild tenderness to palpation at both costovertebral angles and there was no spinal tenderness. 
ABDOMEN: Soft with moderate tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium , there was no rebound or guarding , she had normal bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no Murphy's sign , and no masses. 
There were no cerebellar findings and her reflexes were 1+ of the upper extremities and 0 at the knees with toes downgoing bilaterally. 
Until this titer came back , however , the diagnosis was not as clear and the patient had a PPD planted with anergy panel. 
This PPD was negative and the patient was not anergic. 
Pulmonary consultation was obtaind to consider bronchoscopy as the patient could not produce sputum for the first several days of her admission. 
A typhus antibody was sent given her possible exposure to typhus and that is still pending although unlikely to be the case given her improvement on Bactrim and Erythromycin and the fact that she has a positive Legionella titer. 
Her heart rate eventually came down with fluids although she was not markedly orthostatic on admission. 
With fluid repletion , her heart rate did come down and subsequent EKG revealed that she was not in AV flutter with a 2:1 block but indeed was in sinus tachycardia. 
As noted over the subsequent days , she became afebrile with stable blood pressure and improving respiratory rate and O2 saturations. 
As noted above , her white count improved and she remained afebrile except for single episode of low grade fevers on 1/3 immediately prior to discharge. 
She tolerated the switch well without any complications.

ABDOMEN: Cyst palpable liver , no mass noted , soft. 
EXTREMITIES: 2+ edema , with bilateral venous stasis ulcer , with no signs of active infection. 
NEURO: Alert and oriented , with no focal deficits. 
ABIs were obtained , which showed both left and right ABIs greater than 1 , also PVRs were normal throughout and it was felt that there was no vascular component to these nonhealing ulcers , and they recommended that it was due to venous stasis changes and chronic edema and felt local wound care and leg elevation would be the treatment of choice at this point. 
Patient , with some evidence of poor dentition , was seen by the Dental Team , which felt that there was no evidence of active infection at this time that needed further dental treatment prior to her surgery. 
Patient was also seen by Dermatology , who felt these were venous stasis ulcers and recommended Hibiclens wash , as well as Silvadene dressing with Xeroform gauze , and leg elevation , and also recommended lower noninvasive to rule out DVT , which was obtained on 4/25/03 which showed no evidence of DVT. 
The patient with improvement of her venous stasis ulcers; however , they are still open , and with discussion with the Cardiac Surgery chief fellow it was discussed that until they were healed with new valves in place that they would like to continue the triple antibiotics of vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl , and will be discharged to the rehab with those antibiotics.

G V P VI. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 49 year old lady was admitted with increasing shortness of breath and increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilated cardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list. 
It subsequently was revealed that there was a strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact , subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore altered from alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. 
She represented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heart failure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril and Zaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic support for a short period of time. 
Two of her sons as I mentioned were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy , one of whom remains quite unwell. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Alert and oriented , in no distress. 
She had no bruits and no thyromegaly. 
Her respiratory examination showed her lungs were markedly clear to percussion and auscultation without wheeze. 
Abdomen was mildly distended without evidence of shifting dullness. 
She had no peripheral edema and good peripheral pulses. 
Chest x-ray showed a large globular heart without fluid in the bases with mild upper lobe venous diversion. 
IMPRESSION: This was a 49 year old lady with dilated cardiomyopathy , probably familial in nature , with increased abdominal girth and shortness of breath , on the transplant list , admitted for diuresis , plus or minus optimization therapy. 
However in the setting of changing her diuretic medications and a hospital diet , this was considered this could be delayed until her next outpatient visit with Dr. Gasaway DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d.; amiodarone 200 mg q.d.; digoxin 0.0625 mg q.d.; M.V.I. therapeutic 1 tablet q.d.; K-Dur 14 mEq t.i.d.; Aldactone 50 mg q.d.; Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.; Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg q. o.d.; Coumadin 5 mg q. h.s.

Of note , the patient denied any dysuria , cough , sinus pain , diarrhea , ear pain , pleuritic chest pain , calf pain , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 4/5 2. Hypertension. 
When he first presented with this condition , the patient had a near complete paralysis of his motor function in his upper extremities without loss of his sensory function , per report. 
8. Cervical stenosis and foraminal stenosis , as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%. 
MEDICATIONS: Metformin 1000 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 500 mg p.o. q.p.m. , simvastatin 5 mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d. , which had been tapered down to 300 mg q.d. , and then plan for discontinuation , Nexium 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. b.i.d. , amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Senna , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , methadone 5 mg p.o. p.r.n. pain , and regular insulin sliding scale , and cefotaxime 2 g IV injections t.i.d. ( final dose on the day of admission ). 
JVP was around 9 cm , no lymphadenopathy. 
Chest exam: Bibasilar crackles and right-sided bronchial breath sounds and question focal wheeze. 
Other possibilities included bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma or lymphoma per the radiologic read , but was not consistent with the clinical presentation. 
On follow up chest x-rays throughout the hospital course , the patient's infiltrate resolved with a chest x-ray on 5/11/05 showing clear lungs and only prior cardiac surgery evident without worsening or continued presence of the right upper lobe infiltrate. 
To cover other gram-negative sources for his pneumonia , the Infectious Disease Service also suggested continuing and ceftazidime treatment as well. 
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Given the patient's history of diabetes and shortness of breath , the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three negative cardiac enzymes. 
By the end of his hospitalization , the patient was not requiring any oxygen supplementally and was discharged with euvolemia. 
Interestingly , the Cardiovascular Service suggested that possibly some ground-glass opacities on the patient's chest CT could be attributed to amiodarone lung toxicity. 
It had been attributed to possible line infection given a history of a tick bite. 
Fortunately , with physical therapy and with time and possibly with infusion of the IV cefotaxime , the patient's motor function has improved. 
4. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with diabetes mellitus. 
In addition , he will continue his ACE inhibitor for his diabetes , as well as for his significant cardiac disease. 5. Pulmonary: Much of his pulmonary process can be attributed to his pneumonia as treated in the statements above.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Cleared history of heart transplant , history of rheumatic fever , diabetes mellitus type 1 , gastroesophageal reflux disease , chronic renal insufficiency , and osteoporosis. 
HISTORY: The patient is a 65-year-old woman with history of rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis ultimately requiring heart transplant in August of 1993 , diabetes mellitus type #1 , and chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.8. 
The BUN to creatinine ratio trended upwards up to 31/2.3 from 29/1.7 on admission and then she was transferred to cardiology 3 for management of hypoxia , fever , acute and chronic renal failure , and developing hypertension to the 90s , systolic from a baseline of 105. 
V1 that showed RS duration of 80 milliseconds , not significantly changed from February , 2003. 
Echocardiogram on January , 2003 , had shown an ejection fraction of 50% to 55% with mild left ventricular enlargement and preserved systolic function , mild posterior and lateral hypokinesis , normal right ventricular size and function , mitral valves mildly thickened with mild MR. Stress echocardiogram on February 2003 , showed no inducible ischemia. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As noted above , rheumatic heart disease status post heart transplant in 1993 , diabetes mellitus type 1 , GERD , chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of 1.8. 
Status post cholecystectomy. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Musculoskeletal: The operation was without complications with minimal bleeding. 
She was able to move her toes with the splint in place and there were no orthopedic complications from the procedure. 
She was transferred to the CCU for possible sepsis because her blood pressure continued to drop to the 60 and 70 systolic and required Dopamine IV. 
For ischemia , she was given aspirin and her home Pravachol for her ischemic risk factors including diabetes and high cholesterol. 
When she returned to the floor , her diuresis remained good off the Lasix , possibly related to post ATN diuresis and her ins and outs remained negative. 
The workup for her infection was negative and was presumed that she had community-acquired pneumonia , and it responded well to levofloxacin 10-day course. 
Renal: In the postoperative course , her creatinine rose dramatically to the 5 range , also the possible etiology was multifactorial including dye load with the CT , spiral , as well as history of chronic renal insufficiency likely from diabetes and chronic cyclosporin use. 
Neurology: She did have some waxing and waning of her mental status during the setting of hypotension and fever , although she had a baseline slowed response to questioning. 
She was markedly slower to respond to questioning but normally oriented to place and person.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , the patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of insulin dependent diabetes and hypertension who is in her usual state of health until the morning of presentation when she was sitting at breakfast she felt an increased in drowsiness and faintness with gradual onset over ten minutes while seated. 
She felt as if she was going to collapse but had no visual or motor deficit. 
Per report , the patient experienced no dysarthria or confusion , no focal motor deficit. 
She stood and walked outside noting no changes with standing. 
She denies fall or loss of consciousness. 
At baseline , she has poor exercise tolerance to less than 30 feet without shortness of breath. 
She had no chest pain or palpitations , no cough but mild URI symptoms. 
She did have one subjective temperature the day prior to admission , no change in stools. 
She had some feeling of urinary frequency but no burning , no leg pain or falls. 
She has had no recent change in oral intake. 
Of note , she was recently started on Clonidine for her hypertension. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is notable for insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , a history of a urinary tract infection in the past , bradycardia , chronic edema in her legs , obstructive sleep apnea. 
She denies tobacco or alcohol use. 
She is fatigued with no acute distress. 
She has no scleral icterus. 
She has no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Lungs are clear bilaterally without wheezes or rales. 
Her abdomen is obese but soft , nontender , no pulsatile liver is appreciated. 
She had blood cultures drawn which have returned no growth to date. 
Chest x-ray showed low lung volumes , cardiomegaly without effusion or consolidation. 
The patient had no loss of consciousness , anginal chest symptoms or worsening of her hypertension during this period. 
She was evaluated by the Cardiology Service at I Warho Hospital on the day following admission who found the patient likely not to require pacemaker. 
The recommendation of the Cardiology Service additionally recommended to hold Clonidine and consider restarting atenolol at a low dose of 25 mg p.o. daily. 
The patient was subsequently re-evaluated by the Electrophysiology Service at the I Warho Hospital which assessed the patient to likely not require a pacemaker given her improvement of her bradycardia with the discontinuation of her nodally active medications. 
The patient was maintained on telemetry over the course of her hospitalization with no new or dangerous arrhythmias noted. 
In terms of ischemia , the patient had a negative workup for cardiac ischemia by enzymes x3 and had no further anginal symptoms or changes in her EKG to indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. 
She was noted to have some improvement in her lower extremity edema over her hospital course but it was assessed to be chronic and likely not an issue to be further assessed by her outpatient physician. 
In summary , the patient will be discharged to home without further use of atenolol. 
It is recommended that if the patient has poorly controlled hypertension as an outpatient , she will undergo a trial with an agent that has no activity at the sinoatrial node. 
If the patient continues to have bradycardia related to medications and is unable to have her hypertension controlled by medications that do not cause bradycardia , she may need to be re-evaluated by the electrophysiology service for placement of a pacemaker. 
At this time though , there is no recommended electrophysiologic workup remaining for the patient. 
2. Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission , the patient had a known history of diverticulosis by colonoscopy as well as barium enema , but had no history of acute bright red blood per rectum. 
The patient was clearly orthostatic and unable to stand without dizziness. 
She had no pain with this bleeding and had no evidence of hematemesis. 
The patient was also assessed by surgery who felt the patient not to be an urgent surgical candidate but recommended nasogastric lavage if the patient were to rebleed and further consultation with surgery in that event. 
The patient was observed to be hemodynamically stable over the remainder of her hospitalization with no evidence of drop in blood pressure or new blood per rectum. 
During her hospitalization , the patient's history of refractory hypertension was concerning for the possibility that she may have some degree of underlying renovascular hypertension. 
She has subsequently underwent a secondary hypertension workup which included an a.m. 
She subsequently underwent lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound studies which demonstrated no evidence of venous clots in either of her legs. 
On exam , her legs demonstrated no tenderness to palpation over her major joints and no evidence of frank inflammation. 
Her chest x-ray at time of admission was without infiltrate. 
6. ENT: The patient was continued on her Flonase at her outpatient dose , stable without new complaints at time of dictation. 
It is recommended that he continue to follow his hypertension closely as he has been and use whenever possible agents without sinoatrial nodal activity. 
Recommended next agent if the patient continues to have refractory hypertension would be doxazosin. 
Again , the patient is not assessed to be a candidate for a pacemaker at this time due to the likely medication related bradycardia that she experienced although she continues to have new symptomatic bradycardia.

New atrial fibrillation.. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Berne is a 50 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) performed at I Warho Hospital two weeks prior to his admission. 
On 18 of June , Mr. Berne underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 100% occlusion of the proximal LAD and 70% occlusion of the circumflex. 
He felt no chest pain , no nausea , vomiting , or shortness of breath , but VNA noted that his 150 beats per minute. 
The patient felt well on discharge with no chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , and no syncope. 
As previously , the patient denied associated symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , back pain , PND , or orthopnea. 
The patient was an obese Caucasian male in no apparent distress. 
Oropharynx clear with no exudate or erythema. 
Neck supple with no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy , no thyroid enlargement. 
Clear to auscultation with no rales or wheezes. 
No murmur , S3 , or S4. Carotid pulses 2+ bilaterally , no bruits. 
Abdominal exam , soft , nontender , nondistended , no organomegaly , plus bowel sounds. 
Extremities , no cyanosis , edema , or tenderness , warm and well perfused with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. 
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion but no evidence of congestive heart failure or infiltrate. 
The echocardiogram from 27 of February also showed left ventricle normal in size with moderate concentric LVH , reduced LV function , left atrium enlargement , with no evidence of thrombus. 
Other causes for atrial fibrillation were considered. 
New onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was felt to be consistent with pericardial inflammation post surgery. 
However , this attempt at pharmacological cardioversion did not succeed in attaining normal sinus rhythm. 
There was a significant concern regarding the patient's decreased ejection fraction to 30% from preoperative 45% , felt to be possibly secondary to negative inotropic medications as well as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
In addition to his previous medications , the patient was discharged on Digoxin .25 mg q day and with instructions to follow up with Dr. Meduna regarding his dose of procainamide as well as the possibility of adding a low dose ace inhibitor.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53-year-old woman with mild mental retardation , schizophrenia , and borderline diabetes mellitus who was transferred from Whid Downdoc Rehabilitation Of for further cardiac evaluation after a non Q wave myocardial infarction. 
They took her to the hospital and she was admitted for what they thought was primary gastrointestinal process , but they noted increasing GGTs without alkaline phosphatase changes in her laboratory panel. 
She was placed on a rule out myocardial infarction protocol and subsequently ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with CKs of 235 , 6.3% , 246 , 7.7% MBs and 197 , 7.6% MBs. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mild mental retardation , schizophrenia , borderline diabetes mellitus , and morbid obesity. 
Her cardiac risk factors include family history , borderline hypertension. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese woman in no obvious distress. 
She had distant heart sounds without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Abdomen was markedly obese with a right upper quadrant tenderness to deep palpation. 
The patient was alert and oriented times three and able to understand questions , but she had decreased verbal skills. 
Chest x-ray , by report from Whid Downdoc Rehabilitation Of , showed mild cardiomegaly , pulmonary venous hypertension , elevated right hemidiaphragm. 
Cardiac catheterization was contemplated to rule out ischemia as her source of cardiomyopathy , but given that catheterization would likely require intubation secondary to sedation given her psych issues , the decision was made to pursue a more conservative course with treatment of medication. 
She was aggressively treated for congestive heart failure with digoxin , Ace inhibitor , and IV Lasix and she continued to get IV Lasix b.i.d. 40 mg. 
She continued to have , on admission , an elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase in the absence of significant transaminases , it was not consistent with passive congestion alone. 
She was not treated with antibiotics. 
She had total body edema and anasarca with slightly decreased protein and albumin , but most likely secondary to severe congestive heart failure. 
Her mucous membranes were dry , but felt this was secondary to her breathing and possible intervascular depletion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 75 year old female , with a history of coronary artery disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and diabetes , who presented with chest tightness and a nonproductive cough. 
The patient denied fevers , chills , night sweats , or dizziness. 
She had no diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting. 
The patient initially presented to Akcare Hospital where chest x-ray was clear , without evidence of infiltrate. 
In the Emergency Department at PUO , it was felt that the patient deserved admission to the Short Stay Unit for very mild congestive heart failure exacerbation and bronchospastic episode. 
The patient had previously been treated with Biaxin and then switched to Augmentin in the Short Stay Unit for treatment of possible bronchitis. 
Other issues in the Short Stay Unit were a question of an infection of the left great toe with a history of diabetes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) History of congestive heart failure. 
2 ) Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1994 , LIMA to LAD and an SVG graft to OM1 , distal OM1 and RCA. 3 ) Insulin dependent diabetes. 
7 ) Status post bilateral total knee replacements. 
, Augmentin 250/125 mg t.i.d. , and Lotrimin 1%. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and grown children in Riry Street , Green Xing Tempe The patient denied tobacco or ethanol history. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this was an elderly female sitting in a chair in no apparent distress. 
Oropharynx was clear , without lesions. 
Neck had 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally without bruits. 
Heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no rubs , gallops , or murmurs.

Status post bilateral total knee replacement scars were notable. 
She was status post coronary artery bypass grafting. 
She had notable degenerative joint disease of the thoracic spine. 
There was no evidence of acute disease. 
The patient was also continued on 40 mg of Prednisone p.o. q.d. , as well as Augmentin for question of bronchitis. 
As well , a bone scan obtained to rule out chronic osteomyelitis of the left great toe , the results of which on the preliminary reading were as follows. 
The left foot potentially could be underperfused in relation to the right foot secondary to diabetic vascular changes. 
She also demonstrated an abnormal right mid foot at the proximal metatarsophalangeal joints of the medial three metatarsals , possibly consistent with neuropathic joint. 
There was also a prominence of bilateral tibial components of the knees which could be suggestive of prosthetic loosening , however , this was not confirmed by clinical exam. 
In essence , there was no evidence of chronic osteomyelitic changes. 
If symptoms were to worsen or not improve fully , the patient is to follow-up again with her primary medical doctors , Dr. Heam or Dr. Burle , as well as potentially setting her up in the Infectious Disease Clinic for further follow-up. 
As to the remainder of her medical issues , the patient was maintained on her home medications and demonstrated no issues. 
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to make an appointment and follow-up with Dr. Burle for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma flare.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Following cardiac catheterization , Mr. Mclaney was admitted for tailored therapy , and was started on nitroprusside in addition to IV diuresis with Lasix , Captopril , and Isordil. 
LFTs gradually decreased throughout his hospitalization , and were likely elevated due to passive congestion due to heart failure. 
Also alcohol use is possible but less likely due to the pattern of elevated LFTs. 
He had no further episodes of diarrhea , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting. 
Thus , no further workup was done at this time. 
Of note , he was on Fannie Rippel protocol and was randomized to hemodynamic therapy. 
By 10/15/97 , he continued to feel very well without any complaints of dyspnea on exertion , light-headedness , dizziness , or shortness of breath. 
He did begin to complain of cough , possibly productive of clear sputum , beginning on this day. 
He did have one episode of a four beat run of asymptomatic nonsustained V-tach which was well-tolerated. 
EKG was without changes on exercise. 
Peak V. O2 of 14.3 and without ischemia. 
Lasix dose was optimized with final dose of 40 mg p.o. Cough continued , and a chest x-ray was obtained which was negative for infiltrate. 
As part of his transplant workup , an abdominal ultrasound was negative , although of note , his gallbladder could not be optimally visualized due to a contraction of the gallbladder. 
He denied any shortness of breath , chest pains , palpitations , and was felt to be stable for discharge. 
PROCEDURES: He underwent an echocardiogram on 9/20/97 , ETT 9/20/97 , abdominal ultrasound 9/20/97 , pulmonary function test 11/3/97 , cardiac catheterization 4/28/97.

She has no known cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol. 
The T-wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin. 
The patient was admitted in a rule out protocol. 
No ventricular thrombus was noted. 
Initially , she was presumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silent prior to this. 
Unfortunately , the patient's blood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and , despite efforts to scale it back in dosages , the majority of the medicines were held. 
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on September The cardiac catheterization was notable for a right atrial pressure of 5. Right ventricular pressure of 36/10. 
The left heart catheterization noted normal coronary arteries without evidence of significant coronary disease. 
Her left ventriculogram also noted a preserved ejection fraction with no focal wall motion abnormalities. 
The patient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention of coronary disease , as her other medications were discontinued. 
The patient's transaminases were noted to be less than 10 in September of 1998. 
The patient's hepatitic serologies were sent and were notable for positive hepatitis B core antigen , whereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis C , hepatitis A and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. 
She had a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated a dilatation of the common bile duct to 1 cm with some biliary sludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions. 
Given the patient's isolated increase in AST and ALT and bilirubin without an increase in alkaline phosphatase , the diagnosis of ischemic hepatotoxicity was entertained by the GI service. 
The patient was asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout her hospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy or asterixis. 
The patient was not discharged on antibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection. 
She received vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days as empiric treatment for vitamin K depletion secondary to chronic alcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic synthetic dysfunction.

The day of admissio he said his breathing felt more labored and he contacted EMS to take him to the PUO ED. He also reported worsening exercise tolerance and an increase in bilateral lower extremity edema over the past few months , accompanied by a 20lb weight gain. 
He was treated in the ED with supplemental O2 and Levofloxacin and admitted with a diagnosis of COPD flare and right heart failure. 
--PE upon admission: afebrile , P 101 , R 28 , BP 150/70 , O2 sat 99% 2L NC Pulm- labored breathing , accessory muscle use , rhonchi and expiratory wheezes present throughout both lung fields. 
--Sig labs and tests upon admission: BUN 17 , Cr 1.4 , Glucose 179. 
Since he reported left sided pleuritic chest pain , we evaluated the possibility of PE with a V/Q scan that reported a low probability of PE. 2. ) CV- Pt's physical exam demonstrated signs of right-sided heart failure , notably 12 cm JVD , hepatomegaly and later hepatojugular reflex , and 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. 
We proceeded to treat his heart failure by diuresis with Lasix , initially PO and then IV. Overall , he diuresed approximately 1L fluid. 
To further evaluate his heart failure , a cardiac MRI was obtained and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and function. 
His LVEF was 73% and he had no valvular dysfunction. 
Since he remained afebrile and did not demonstrate an elevated WBC , we did not treat with antibiotics. 
4. ) Endo- His diabetes was managed with his home regimen of Novolog. 
Steroids may have contributed to his elevated blood sugars. 
Because of his history of cancer , he was placed on Lovenox for anticoagulation. 
Episodic hypoxia while sleeping may contribute to pulmonary HTN and signs of right heart failure observed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year-old woman who had coronary artery bypass graft in 1993 who presents with ten minutes of acute chest pain today. 
The second time this happened , she went to the Ow. Rehabilitation Hospital Of there in Lub Na Hunt with the complaints of diaphoresis and some nausea , although she did not have chest pain , shortness of breath , vomiting or palpitations. 
Since she had been home from Quezon Boulevard , La More E , Kentucky 57872 , she really had not had repeat episodes of diaphoresis. 
She describes this pain as exactly like the anginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypass graft. 
By the time she presented to the Emergency Room , she had no diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal. 
In July of 1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerance test with Thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversible defects. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass graft with cardiac risk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol , hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
She does not smoke and drinks wine occasionally. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , elderly woman in no apparent distress. 
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 and a two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with no gallop or rub. 
Extremities revealed no edema. 
Neurological examination was non-focal. 
Chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this is a woman with known coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstable angina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and now substernal chest pain. 
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
The EKG had no changes with a left bundle branch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
She subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her known underlying native disease. 
After the cardiac catheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at the puncture site and a bruit was noted.

She notes that she can no longer walk from room to room without resting and she used to be able to walk around her house. 
She also notes a frequent need to "get air" which also wakes her from sleep. 
She was unable to name her home medications , but stated that she took four medications plus insulin which is in accordance with her LMR notes. 
She has not been able to check her fingerstick blood glucose levels recently because her machine has been broken. 
She denies chest pain , tightness except with coughing. 
She denies pleuritic pain , any recent illness , any sick contacts , any change in urinary or bowel habits , any nausea or vomiting , night sweats , diaphoresis or pain in her jaw or arms. 
Of note , her KTDUOO primary care physician , Dr. Alverta Burvine , note from September 2004 noted tachycardia greater than 100 with decreased exercise tolerance , inability to lie flat , and snoring and daytime sleepiness. 
At this time , an echocardiogram performed in January 2004 revealed an EF of 60 to 65% , trace PR and no regional wall motion abnormality. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension. 
The patient is not currently on anticoagulation. 
Type II diabetes mellitus. 
Morbid obesity. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco use , alcohol use , drugs. 
She lives with her daughter who is one of her four children , and eight of her 14 grandchildren in Cuse A Wa She does not work. 
In general , the patient is an obese , pleasant woman in no apparent distress. 
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds throughout secondary to body habitus , but no crackles or wheeze noted. 
Hyperpigmentation noted around neck and under breasts. 
The patient was maintained on aspirin , Lipitor 80 mg , beta-blocker , and ACE inhibitor. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 8/10/05 which revealed a 50% LAD lesion , a 70% D1 lesion. 
These lesions were not intervened upon at the time of dictation. 
Rhythm: The patient has remained tachycardic and has been monitored on tele with no noted abnormalities. 
On the night of 8/10/05 following cardiac catheterization , the patient had a 13 beat run of nonsustained V. tach on telemetry. 
As noted above , she will undergo cardiac viability study on 4/30/05 and may receive evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service. 
However , when she was admitted , she exhibited only tachycardia without evidence of tachypnea or hypoxia and her clinical course thus far , as well as her PE protocol CT is not suggestive of this diagnosis. 
She does experience dyspnea on exertion , however , has not been hypoxic at any point. 
Her last hemoglobin A1c check was close to 12. Given her concerning findings of coronary artery disease , she will need to maintain much tighter control of her blood glucose in the future. 
The patient's productive cough was thought to be not due to infection.

Also , reports dysuria in the setting of indwelling Foley since 6/8 Denies fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , no melena or bright red blood per rectum in the last six months but reports melena and bright red blood per rectum intermittently in 2003 in the setting of colonoscopy that was positive for diverticula. 
The patient was obese nonmobile , alert and oriented x3 and in no apparent distress. 
She had no conjunctival pallor. 
JVP could not be assessed due to body habitus. 
Her abdomen was obese , she had positive bowel sound. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: In summary , this is a 60-year-old morbidly obese woman who presented with acute and chronic renal failure and anemia. 
ATN also possibility but urine sodium was 29. 
Postrenal etiology was ruled out with a renal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis. 
However , the patient initially appeared to fail volume challenge with no acute change in creatinine past 3.2 from 10/18/05 to 4/20/05. 
At that time , Vascular Surgery was consulted for AV fistula placement in the setting of GFR of approximately 17 that was not improving. 
AV fistula was placed on 1/13/05 in the left arm without complication. 
The patient should not be restarted on these medications because it will precipitate worsening kidney failure. 
Hematocrit did not bump appropriately after transfusion of 4 units. 
3. Cardiovascular/Pump - ECHO with EF equal to 65% here , moderate diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension. 
No rhythm or ischemia issues during hospital course , low HDL , started on statin. 
Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 , so no evidence of diabetes. 
8. Psyche: Zoloft continued for depression. 
9. Pulmonary: Intermittent , the patient intermittently desaturates on room air to 80s but always resolved with repositioning and O2. Likely secondary to respiratory muscle deconditioning and to restrictive lung disease in the setting of morbid obesity. 
Continuing Flovent for asthma and albuterol nebs p.r.n. for wheezing. 
Continue CPAP at night for obstructive sleep apnea. 
Oncology: History of breast mass last evaluated in 4/20 at which time the risk of surgery would determine to be greater than the possible risk of breast cancer. 
Oncology not able to see patient during inpatient stay but will schedule outpatient followup regarding the issue of possible treatment with tamoxifen. 
p.r.n. for shortness of breath and wheezing , ECASA 81 mg p.o. daily , PhosLo 667 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Catapres 0.1 mg per day q. weekly , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , metoprolol tartarate 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , senna tablets two tabs p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. for constipation , ocean spray two sprays inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. for dry nose , Coumadin 12.5 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.a.m. , azithromycin 250 mg p.o. daily x10 days , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. at bedtime , doxazosin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. daily , Claritin 10 mg p.o. daily , Flovent 110 mcg inhaled b.i.d. , cefpodoxime proxetil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. x10 days , Flonase one spray daily , levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.24 x10 doses , and Nexium 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

At his recent hospital stay , he was evaluated for PFO , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic blood pressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. 
Had a troponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and was considered to be demand related. 
His abdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid and had no peritoneal signs. 
2. Non insulin-dependent diabetes. 
IMPORTANT STUDIES: 1. Chest PA and lateral dated 1/10/06 , increased opacification seen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning for pneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasis was seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions are possible , and heart size is normal. 
2. Abdominal ultrasound on 3/1/06 : 1 ) Contracted gallbladder with gallstones. 
3. KUB dated 4/5/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , no high-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact. 
The patient was found to have a pansensitive E. coli UTI and a questionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likely been due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke and documented aspiration by Speech and Swallow on previous admission. 
The Levaquin , which will cover both the urinary tract infection and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a total of a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. 
The patient's blood cultures showed no growth. 
When the Foley was taken out , the patient did not void at all. 
A GGT was drawn and found to also be elevated at 119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed , which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but no acute cholecystitis. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Urinary retention leading to urinary tract infection , possible aspiration pneumonia.

Observed in ED overnight with plans for morning discharge , but became questionably hypoxemic ( O2 sat low 90s ) and somewhat subjectively dyspneic. 
The physicians in the emergency room thought that the patient was having an asthma exacerbation and gave the patient prednisone 60mg x 1 , combivent/albuterol nebulizer treatment , levofloxacin/clindamycin for possible aspiration pneumonia , and admitted her to the medical floor for further evaluation and treatment. 
On admission to the floor , the patient was found to have normal oxygen saturations in the mid 90s on room air and was not thought to have any concurrent bronchospasm or focal sounds of a pneumonia. 
Her chest x ray was negative , she was not having fevers and her white blood count was normal. 
She was not volume overloaded on exam. 
She received an echocardiogram to investigate possible cardiomyopathy or congestive failure , and this showed a normal ejection fraction without obvious structural abnormalities except for mild bilateral atrial dilatation.

Well healed midline incision , no drainage , no erythema. 
Extremities are nontender without edema. 
KUB showed a large amount of stool in the large bowel , no free air , a few air fluid levels , overall picture was not consistent with small bowel obstruction. 
The patient was admitted with a question of gastroenteritis vs. partial small bowel obstruction , which would be early. 
Her KUB and upright that was repeated still showed a large amount of stool in the large bowel , few air fluid levels but no change from the earlier exam. 
There was a small section of small bowel with wall thickening at the paraumbilical level with fluid around it and no absence of small bowel obstruction. 
Given that the exam was not quite consistent with the CT readings , other things were considered in the differential. 
The concern was raised on the 24 of June that if this was not consistent with ischemic bowel , that perhaps this was an exacerbation of her vasculitis and could represent vasculitic changes in her SMA circulation which had improved because the patient was placed on stress post steroids. 
There was no evidence of microaneurysm , narrowing or dilation. 
Because of these findings , it was felt that this was not a picture consistent with vasculitis.

She denied sick contacts , had GI biopsy in middle of 5/24 that showed focal colitis , without signs of GVHD. 
The patient was given prescription for steroids three days prior to admission , but did not complete or fill the prescription , was admitted from the clinic with significant skin rash that was consistent with graft versus host disease. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes breast cancer in 1/25 , myelodysplastic syndrome , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. 
ALLERGIES: She describes no allergies to medications. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is divorced with one son , denies alcohol or illicit drug intake. 
There is no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. 
There is no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
GI biopsy done on 5/10/05 showed grade II graft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade I graft versus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes. 
ONTAK was given on 6/17/05 , 9/6/05 , and 10/22/05 without adverse events. 
2. Hematology: The patient with no active bleeding was transfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than 20. 
4. Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable , did not get hypotensive throughout the admission. 
6. Pulmonary: The patient had one episode of dyspnea when speaking on 11/16/05 , which resolved without further symptoms throughout the admission. 
The patient had chest x-ray on 10/6/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without other abnormalities. 
7. Gastrointestinal: Mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely a component of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouth coat is helpful to her. 
Colonoscopy on 5/10/05 revealed stage II GVHD on biopsy with no gross visual evidence of bleed. 
The colonoscopy was notable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internal hemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graft versus host disease. 
She was not a candidate for surgical intervention due to immunosuppression and infection risk. 
This is likely secondary to combination to venous insufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. 
The cuff has been exposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , not tender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity and diabetes mellitus with recently diagnosed abdominal wall cellulitis status post a three week stay at Kendsonre Ale Ater Hospital . 
She denies loss of consciousness , she was found on the floor lying on her back. 
She denies fever or chills. 
She does have abdominal pain , denies nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , increased urinary frequency or dysuria. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for obesity and diabetes. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
In general , she is obese , tachypneic , and uncooperative. 
HEENT , supple neck , no jaundice , moist oral mucosa. 
CV , tachycardic without murmur. 
Abdomen , lower abdominal wall with extensive areas of erythema and induration with an open wound 5 x 7 cm , no pus or drainage , tender to palpation. 
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates. 
An abdominal CT done at KAAH on 1/10 showed stranding and fluid and gas along the anterior aspect of the abdominal wall without evidence of abscess. 
An echo done at KAAH showed normal left ventricular function without valvular disease , with an EF of 64 percent. 
It was thought that the patient did not require any further surgical debridement , she is status post two surgical debridements at KAAH . 
It was recommended by the ID service that the patient does need an abdominal CT to rule out an abscess given the stranding seen on prior CT at KAAH , however , the patient was too large for the CT table at the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of , as well as for an MRI table , it will have to be assessed as to whether the patient may be transferred to another facility for abdominal imaging to rule out abscess , until that time wet-to-dry dressings will continue to the wound and antibiotics will be continued IV. Endocrine: The patient was given a regimen of NPH 14 units b.i.d. and an insulin sliding scale with excellent control of blood sugar. 
Her admission albumin was 1.5 , indicative of severe protein calorie malnutrition , and her severe malnutrition was also thought to be the contributing , if not causative , factor to the patient's renal failure. 
The patient did have polyuria from yeast but this was thought to be colonization and not actual infection. 
However , psychiatry felt like her suicidal ideation was most likely indicative of a borderline type personality disorder , so it was not thought that she was actively suicidal and did not require a one to one sitter. 
The patient refused multiple evaluations by psychiatry to evaluate for competence as the patient often did not want to listen when attempts to explain to her her medical problems and the consequences concerning medical decisions were attempted.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension and blindness who presents with three days of acute abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. 
Since then , she has not been feeling well , and not been eating much , but did not have any further episodes of emesis. 
She did have chills overnight , but no sweats or no fevers and no diarrhea. 
Has not had any recent viral illnesses , although did have a recent flu shot. 
Did not have any sick contact. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She also endorsed a small amount of an intentional weight loss and denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , cough , or symptoms suggestive of fluid overload. 
4. Osteoarthritis. 5. Status post total hip replacement. 
In general , she was comfortable and in no acute distress. 
Her neck showed no thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy , and her JVP was flat. 
Heart with a regular rate and rhythm , and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border without radiation. 
Abdomen was soft with decreased bowel sounds throughout and diffuse moderate tenderness to palpation without rebound , guarding , or Murphy. 
Skin showed no rashes. 
Amylase was 133 , lipase was 86 , albumin was 3.7 , and a urinalysis showed 2+ ketones , a specific gravity of 1.112 , no white blood cells , and 2+ squamous epithelial cells. 
IMAGING: An EKG showed no change from her prior diffuse T-wave flattening and T-wave inversion with normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute. 
An abdominal CT was consistent with pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding , and there was stones seen in the gallbladder; however , there was no common bile duct dilatation and no pseudocyst or evidence of necrosis in the pancreas. 
ASSESSMENT: This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with acute abdominal pain and an abdominal CT consistent with pancreatitis with gallstones in the gallbladder , but without evidence of obstruction. 
Laboratory values on CT findings on admission with no evidence of pseudocyst or necrosis or other surgical complications of pancreatitis. 
Though likely etiology for pancreatitis was gallstone given that there were gallstones seen on her abdominal CT and that she had elevation of some of her LFTs. 
The common bile duct looked not dilated , but right at the upper limits of normal. 
Given this borderline values she was also sent for MRCP to rule out CBD dilatation in the event that she may need cholecystectomy in the future. 
The MRCP showed again no evidence of obstruction of the duct and no evidence of cholecystitis. 
By the time of discharge , she was tolerating a regular diet without any recurrence of her abdominal pain , nausea , or vomiting , and was not requiring any further pain medication. 
She was given an appointment to follow up with the LMC General Surgery Clinic for evaluation for likely cholecystectomy and instructed that this would be her plan of care after discharge. 
In terms of ischemia , the patient did have some T-wave flattening diffusely on her EKG; however , had no chest pain. 
In terms of pump , she was aggressively fluid rehydrated , given her dehydration on admission , and her diagnosis of pancreatitis , but did not have any signs of fluid overload at any point during her hospitalization , and was returned to all p.o. diet without need for IV fluids prior to discharge. 
Her blood pressure was well controlled originally with her home medication of Norvasc and then with a change to Lopressor in order to obtain good rate control as well without bouts of hypertension throughout this admission. 
In terms of rhythm , the patient did have some episodes of likely atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia on telemetry early in her admission. 
These episodes would last only a few seconds and resolved spontaneously and the patient did not have symptoms from these. 
By the time of discharge , she had had no events on telemetry for greater than 36 hours. 
She was not started on any antibiotics throughout the admission. 
She has followup appointments with her primary care provider , Dr. Grillette , and also with the LMC General Surgery Clinic regarding possible cholecystectomy. 
She was instructed not to take her Norvasc any more and to take instead the Toprol. 
4. Premarin 0.9 mg p.o. daily ( however , it is recommended that her PCP consider weaning off this medication given its known risks and recent evidence-based literature , and also given the possible risk of gallstones of this medication ).

Given limitations of imaging modalities due to his severe spinal stenosis , MIBI/ETT were not feasible , so the patient presented for elective catheterization 5/16/06. 
Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding stents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0% occlusion. 
During the catheterization , Dr. Surette noted a gradient of 40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the possibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Hoschek 's severe lower back pain and limited ability to ambulate. 
The catheterization was without complications. 
Groin sheaths were removed and the patient was without hematoma or bruit. 
He had 2 episodes of chest pressure several hours following the procedure with negative EKG and stable vitals; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur. 
On discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortness of breath.

3. Osteoarthritis. 
5. Hypertension , degenerative joint disease. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Aubrey is an 83 year old woman with a history of myasthenia gravis , arthritis , pernicious anemia and hypertension and degenerative joint disease with nerve impinging resulting in decreased reflexes in the left lower extremity. 
She was able to walk with assistance and returned to bed and did not feel like she needed to call a physician at that time. 
She then awoke at approximately six in the morning and was able to walk without assistance to wash her face and then to eat breakfast. 
However , at breakfast , the son noted that she was using her right hand clumsily cutting pieces of banana onto the floor , not adequately reaching her mouth to feed herself and had begun to use her knife to eat her cereal. 
With entering the car , did not pick up her right leg well. 
She denies having had any previous neurologic events similar to this episode. 
An LP at that time revealed no white cells and red cells which cleared with successive tubes. 
With regards to her current episode , she denies having any symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting and palpitations. 
She has not had any febrile illness , nausea or vomiting recently. 
She has not had any episodes of a shade coming down before her eyes. 
3. Spine degenerative joint disease , LS spine CT in 1/11 showed most marked deterioration at the L4-L5 vertebra with spondylolisthesis , bilateral foraminal narrowing and moderate spinal stenosis. 
This is an outmoded medication however because she has been on it so long , it has not been discontinued. 
However , she has been noted to suffer from some mild depression. 
5. Osteoarthritis affecting mostly the hands and feet followed by Dr. Etta Six at I Warho Hospital 6. 
12. Right kidney 15 mm simple cyst noted incidentally on the abdominal CT. MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Prednisone 12.5 mg q.o.d. , Daypro 600 mg q day ( arthritis medication ) , Mestinon 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Reserpine 0.25 mg q day and Phenobarbital 15 mg to 30 mg q h.s. ( for sleep ). 
EXAM: The patient is an elderly appearing woman with a lively voice and no apparent distress. 
Throat without erythema. 
Coronary: Regular rate and rhythm , possible faint systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border , no carotid bruits. 
Joint deformities in the hands include the distal interphalangeal joints which is nonconsistent with rheumatoid arthritis , ulnar deviation of the hand is present. 
Patient can span five forward , backwards and misses rely and tune , possibly mild decreased attention. 
Cranial nerves II: Right pupil is slightly larger than left pupil , reactive , visual fields full to confrontation , 3 , 4 , 6 , possible decreased abduction and vertical upgaze of the right eye. 
However , she denies double vision. 
There is possibly decreased left nasolabial fold on the left , however , smile is symmetric. 
Power: Deltoid , biceps and triceps 5/5 , bilaterally symmetric , however does not raise her right deltoid as high. 
EHL possibly slightly diminished strength on the right. 
Has increased difficulty with heel to shin on the right leg probably suggestive of proximal right lower extremity weakness not apparent on cognition testing. 
Heel to shin slightly worse on the right lower extremity , possibly secondary to proximal flexor weakness. 
Incidentally , she says it is because she needs shoes for arthritis , marked pronation of the ankle on small steps. 
Phenobarb level not detected. 
Tox screen positive for Benzodiazepine ( this may have been due to sedation she received for the CT. However , it is not clear that she received sedation ). 
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an elderly woman with hypertension , myasthenia gravis and arthritis who presented with weakness of her right lower extremity and right hand and some confusion as evidenced by using a knife to eat her cereal instead of a spoon. 
Her exam was notable for mildly impaired attention , possibly confused clock difficulty with handwriting and decreased strength of the right hand and likely probably decreased strength to the right lower extremity. 
Her presentation was consistent with possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg more than the face. 
The component of confusion however is less explainable based on a deep lesion such as this and raised the possibility of a small cortical insult. 
MRI showed no territorial stroke , just T2 intense abnormalities in the periventricular white matter , corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of small vessel disease. 
Echo and Holter were not suggestive of cardioembolic disease. 
There is also mild LVH , no thrombus was seen. 
Carotid noninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions. 
She showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and was able to walk without assistance on the second hospital day. 
In the setting of the acute stroke , we did not control her blood pressure aggressively. 
We have suggested that she discontinue the use of her Reserpine as intermittent use is problematic especially with this medication and she admits to intermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered from some mild depression that can be associated with Reserpine. 
We did not wish to start this medication in the acute setting.

Gait was mildly wide based with normal heel-to-toe walk , she had no pronator drift , and Romberg was positive. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for possible porphyria attack versus Ativan withdrawal symptoms versus anxiety attack. 
Neurology consultation was obtained who felt that patient's peripheral neuropathy was probably secondary to longstanding diabetes but felt that some of her symptomatology could be consistent with porphyria. 
Patient was also seen by Psychiatry who felt that this episode was consistent with generalized anxiety disorder separated by post dysthymia and suggested phenothiazines which are proven to be safe in porphyria for treatment. 
She was also hyperglycemic on admission which may have contributed to her dehydration.

The patient's chest x-ray showed no infiltrates , no free air. 
KUB showed no signs of obstruction. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's Imuran was held because it was thought that this could be a possible cause of her fever. 
A portable chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure. 
The patient had received 100 mg of IV Compazine for nausea; otherwise , no new medications since admission. 
During her rapid decompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with no effect. 
Her lung exam showed some crackles , but she did not appear to be all that wet. 
Based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a VQ scan was not done. 
Urine and blood cultures were negative as well. 
She did well over the two days following intubation and was extubated on 6 of May A bronchoscopy was considered , given the patient's history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolved over the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary. 
The Pulmonary Consult Team saw her when she was back on the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared to resolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it was decided that this need not be pursued at the present. 
The etiology of the patient's sudden decompensation was never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonary edema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to a viral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.

She denied abdominal pain or swelling. 
PAST HISTORY: Initially she admitted to no past medical problems , however , upon reviewing her chart the following is obvious: chronic hypertension; seizure disorder following motor vehicle accident for which she is on valproic acid , no clearly documented recent seizures; history of asthma for which she takes medicines p.r.n.; history of behavioral disorders with question of pseudoseizures in the past; obesity; multiple drug allergies; cholecystectomy in 1990; appendectomy at age 14; motor vehicle accident with V-P shunt placement in 1980; facial reconstruction times three in 1980; superficial vascular surgery in 1989 for varicosities of the lower extremities. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies tobacco , ethanol or drug use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed an obese white female in mild distress. 
The pupils are equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , no papilledema. 
Reflexes were 1+ without clonus. 
The strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper and right lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as she seemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time of exam. 
She was seen by neurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam with findings localized to the right side. 
She has a history of chronic hypertension in the past and was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before. 
Given her history of chronic hypertension , we felt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated by pregnancy. 
She was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , with good control. 
It is not clear that this was witnessed by anyone else. 
While in the hospital , she had an EEG which suggested some slowing in the right parietal region. 
It was our feeling that these were not true seizures. 
She complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latter part of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. The etiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , although apparently associated with some diarrhea. 
As much as was possible , work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. 
We elected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however , she declined further IV's. 
We have counseled her as much as possible throughout her stay. 
As well , we have emphasized our availability to the patient at all times and tried to be as supportive as possible in these circumstances. 
The etiology of her discomfort is somewhat obscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obvious major organic pathology , including PET , central CNS processes and fulminant hypertension.

She also was quite awake after the first day of her hospitalization. 
She was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where it was found that she had multiple moderate stenoses but without any high-grade or critical stenoses. 
There was some discussion of possibly cardioverting her , but given her recent stroke this will be deferred. 
A decision was made not to introduce an ACE inhibitor at this time given her recent _____ and her baseline renal insufficiency ( 1.8-1.9 ).

The right shoulder was ??_____?? without effusion. 
The left wrist was treated with irrigation and debridement as well as a proximal ??_____?? carpectomy by Dr. Kristian Maglione from hand surgery. 
Intraoperative cultures for fluid aspirate as well as bone tissue from the proximal ??_____?? carpectomy demonstrated coag negative staph. 
Also , Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended a change of antibiotics to ampicillin and gentamicin and vancomycin to treat the coag negative staph in the left wrist aspirate as well as to continue treatment of the previous enterococcus infection. 
No cultures from the current admission have demonstrated enterococcus. 
Finally , the patient was seen by Nutrition who recommended a ??_____?? protein diet with supplements t.i.d. 
After discussion with hematology , an inhibitor screen was sent , however , after the serum was neutralized , PTT was found to be normal so likely the chronic PTT elevation was secondary to a hep block in his PICC line. 
He will require rehab services for mobilization , weightbearing as tolerated , with free range of motion and no restrictions for both lower and the right upper extremity.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Kraft is a 70-year-old male with hypertension , coronary artery disease , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , and a 75-pack-year history of tobacco use , who presented on 7/20 at the Kendsonre Ale Ater Hospital with a four-day history of subjective fever and nonproductive cough. 
The patient denied shortness of breath , chest pain , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
He reported perfuse sweating , usually associated with fever , but denied history of exposure to tuberculosis or history of tuberculosis. 
The patient denied sick contacts and reported having had an influenza vaccine during this past winter as well as having a Pneumovax in the past. 
He denied head trauma. 
He has no history of seizure disorder and was fully conscious throughout the event. 
Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2/10 at which time a 99% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending was noted , which was 30% after PTCA. 
He denies any use of alcohol. 
Neck was supple with full range of motion and no lymphadenopathy. 
There were no no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. 
Extremities revealed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
The patient , at that point , no longer was having urinary incontinence; however , he was noted to have a large postvoid residual of 300 cc. 
The onset of this ataxia was in relation to his current illness; however , given the fact that he was on Coumadin , and due to the fact that he had sustained a fall in the evening of admission , a CT scan was performed to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
He was having no ataxia , whatsoever. 
We feel , in part , that some of this ataxia may have been related to generalized weakness that was associated with his current illness. 
His glucose will need to be followed as an outpatient , and perhaps one might consider a glucometer for him at home to ensure that he has good glucose control.

A beta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated to a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. 
The patient has not been started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated creatinine at this time. 
He has had no further episodes of chest pain. 
2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was titrated. 
He was restarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as well as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. 
The patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn followed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the time of discharge. 
He had decreased episodes of more rapid dysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his medication regimen. 
However , after a substantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service and the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the risks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of significant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of thromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot and thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin anticoagulation. 
4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus regimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units q.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. 
The patient's insulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly oral diabetes medications restarted. 
The patient had not been restarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient as his renal function stabilizes. 
7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to anticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. 
Of note , the patient also had decreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and thus anti-P4 antibody was sent. 
In the meantime , recommend no heparin products. 
As mentioned , the decision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the patient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin anticoagulation. 
8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patient complained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the patient. 
In light of the patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial clot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of acute stroke. 
There was , however , no new stroke seen on the MRI. 
The left internal carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus stenosis. 
The patient declined any procedure such as carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid stenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done. 
The patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on several occasions. 
A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are pending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of disease. 
9. Social: The patient's sister , Genoveva Grieser , is his health care proxy. 
The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery bypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. 
The patient has also declined further procedure for his probable carotid artery stenosis.

855931883 | PUO | 06334183 | | 517218 | 1/24/1992 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 7/18/1992 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 10/24/1992 HISTORY: The patient is a 79-year-old black female with a history of diabetes , hypertension and peripheral vascular disease who presented to the Totin Hospital And Clinic emergency room brought in by the EMTs for unresponsiveness at home. 
Cardiac risk factors were positive for diabetes , hypertension , questionable family history and question of a prior MA. 
She was relatively well with diabetes and hypertension at her baseline until approximately 8 of September when she had a left common femoral angioplasty at Pagham University Of . 
In 27 of May , she had a left fem/pop for vascular insufficiency , and her hospitalization at that time was complicated by some mental status changes and a fever of unknown etiology. 
She was treated with intravenous Cefotetan and IV steroids for reactive airways disease. 
Approximately 15 minutes later , the patient was noted by her family to be unresponsive and EMTs were called. 
The patient was found to be hypotensive , diahporetic and nonverbal with a heart rate in the 20s and EKG that was consistent with complete heart block. 
In the emergency room , her heart rate was noted to be 20. 
A transvenous pacemaker was placed and captured effectively. 
She was given originally , in the emergency room , IV insulin as well and treated with antibiotics including Ceftriaxone , Vancomycin and Gentamicin and transferred to the cardiac care unit because there were no NICU beds available. 
Allergies: No known allergies. 
She does not smoke or drink. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , diabetes , multiple rotator cuff injuries in the past , the femoral and popliteal bypass procedure as noted above and noted to have an increased globulin in the past. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: In the unit , she had IV insulin started for presumed diabetic ketoacidosis. 
The sinus arrest was presumed to be metabolic in origin due to her severe acidosis hyperkalemia secondary to her diabetic ketoaci- dosis. 
In addition , she had been on high dose Verapamil with some question of whether or not this was suppressing her sinus node. 
Because of some abdominal tenderness which was hard to gauge given her decreased mental status while she was intubated , she underwent an abdominal CT that was unremarkable , although very mild pancreatitis was noted. 
It resolved over time as her blood pressure returned to normal. 
On 3 of November , she was transferred to the floor after having received approximately five days of intravenous insulin and a resolution of her hyperglycemia and ketosis. 
Her hospital course on the floor was notable for a titration of her insulin dose. 
Of note , her insulin dose was as high as approximately 30-35 units of NPH q. day in a setting of having received steroids initially on admission and they were continued. 
Her steroids were weaned rapidly and , once steroids were stopped her insulin requirement decreased markedly and she was only on 20 units of NPH a day now. 
Of note , she had two episodes of hypoglycemia in the morning with blood sugars in the 20-30 range , one of which was asymptomatic but one of which was associated with some shaking that responded promptly to administration of juice. 
From an infectious disease standpoint , she had no obvious source for any of her fevers , and she defervesced. 
Her pacemaker was removed , and she had no further cardiac event.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old Afro-American female , first diagnosed with hypertension in 1987. 
She presented to the Emergency Room in 1987 with acute atypical chest pain , and was ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
Exercise tolerance test in 1991 demonstrated consistent , but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
Mild tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary artery pressure estimated at approximately 25. Due to her hypertension and decreased left ventricular function , the patient presents to the I Warho Hospital for a left and right side catheterization , and also for monitoring of her blood pressure. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has not worked since 1995 due to what she states as shortness of breath and chest pain. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , this is a 53 year old female , Afro-American , in no apparent distress. 
Nasal oral pharynx had no discharge , and was clear with no exudates. 
Neck: No adenopathy , no jugular venous distention , no thyromegaly. 
Carotids are 2+ with no bruits. 
Lungs revealed diffuse expiratory wheezes , prolonged expiratory phase , no rhonchi or rales. 
The abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , non-distended , with no obvious hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , and no bruits. 
Globulins of 3.7 , calcium of 9.4 , phosphate of 4.4 , cholesterol of 210 , and triglyceride of 67. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on hospital day number one which demonstrated no coronary artery disease disease , right atrium pressure of 12 , PA pressure of 56/32 with a mean of 38 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20. Cardiac output was 5.1 , SVR of 1459 , and PVR of 282. 
The patient was then admitted to the Floor for workup of her hypertension. 
Other hypertension workup Epinephrine , Dopamine , Metanephrine , VMA and ANA are still pending. 
The patient's hypertension control was attributed to the fact that number one , she stopped smoking during her hospital stay; two , she was inactive and was on bed rest; and three , the possibility of strict compliance with medications while in the hospital.

HPI: This 77-year-old female first noted dysphagia beginning in approximately October 2005. 
Initial endoscopy was performed , which was suspicious for malignancy , however , the patient was on Coumadin and no biopsy was obtained at that time. 
She underwent a repeat upper endoscopy on August , 2005 at the Ronyscutford Community Hospital The EGD revealed that Ms. Hanners had Barrett's esophagus as well as a nodule on the distal esophagus. 
A biopsy of the nodule revealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma at 35 cm. 
It appeared to be rising in association with Barrett's esophagitis. 
It was felt that she was a reasonable candidate for consideration of chemoradiation. 
She had some chills , but no fever , no hemoptysis or diarrhea. 
She has had very poor p.o. intake and she notes some weight loss. 
7. Status post gallbladder removal. 
She does not smoke. 
She does not drink except for occasionally. 
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no crackles or wheezes. 
NECK: There is JVP at 7 cm , low lymphadenopathy. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with positive bowel sounds. 
Her extremities had trace edema with no bruising. 
LABORATORY DATA: Her admission labs were notable for potassium of 2.9 , BUN of 37 and creatinine of 1.6. 
Her LFTs and CBC were within normal limits. 
Unlikely a cardiac cause given no chest pain , no palpitation , and obviously decreased p.o. PLAN: 1. Lightheadedness: Poor p.o. intake and dehydration. 
Nutrition was consulted to evaluate regarding the possible stent in esophagus. 
9. FEN: Replete electrolytes p.r.n. , diabetic diet , and multivitamin. 
Nutrition evaluated her and suggested high calorie supplements , however , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take good p.o. GI was consulted regarding possible stenting of her esophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion that could potentially be causing this nausea. 
On the barium swallow , there was a strict stenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any food to pass through. 
An EGD was performed , which showed some food about a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. 
Interventional radiology was consulted and placed a G-tube without complication. 
Tube feeds were begun and she tolerated them well without complication. 
2. TIA/CVA: On the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that she had decreased ability to move the left side of her body. 
The CT showed no bleeding , and during the CT scan , she regained all function in the left side , however , the CTA did note a large friable clot within her right ICA. 
Based upon her high level of heart disease and high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt that she would be a stent candidate at that time. 
She was continued on Lovenox therapy with Coumadin with the plan to discharge her on medical management for this TIA. 
However , on the morning of 8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop. 
A STAT CT , CTA once again showed no bleed. 
At this point , the clot was noted to have moved from the right ICA into the MCA , and to have dissolved somewhat. 
Based upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery from her stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort of intervention at that time. 
Conversations between Dr. Levandoski , Dr. Steinert and the family were had and it was felt that she was no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , in terms of her other issues. 
4. Acute Renal Failure: On admission , she was noted to have an increased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due to dehydration. 
However , at the time of admission , she had a BUN of 50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasound was normal and showed no further defect over the course of her hospital stay. 
She was monitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed. 
She does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline as well as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing a wide complex rhythm. 
She had no other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital. 
6. Nausea: She was treated with Zofran for her nausea when she was admitted and she continued to have good response to this. 7. Urinary Tract Infection: On the 25 of May she noted that she was having increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an UA was done and it was found to be positive for infection. 
During the time when she was not therapeutic on her Coumadin she was treated with either Lovenox subcu. 
She was on Lovenox or heparin drip throughout her hospitalization for DVT prophylaxis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old man with coronary artery disease status post recent bare metal stenting in August , hypercholesterolemia , CLL and peripheral arterial disease and admitted for increasing right thigh pain and falling hematocrit at rehabilitation. 
The patient denies any blood in the stool , melena , dizziness or lightheadedness. 
He denies any recent trauma. 
He felt some weakness in his right leg but has had no paresthesias or pain. 
He received an abdominal CT , which showed a very large right gluteal hematoma with a fresh fluid levels suggesting acute bleed. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Type II diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease status post MI in 1997. 
The patient has known significant peripheral vascular disease status post left TMA in 4/3 with fem-pop in 4/3 , left foot debridement in 5/26 and finally a left BKA in 6/26 He has congestive heart failure with last ejection fraction of 32% , hyperlipidemia , gout , CLL status post fludarabine x4 cycles in 2004 in which has been stable with no evidence of residual or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy , BPH , chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of 2.5 , and glaucoma. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The patient was in no acute distress. 
Mucous membranes were moist without exudates. 
He had 2+ carotid pulses on both sides without any evidence of bruits. 
He had normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. 
Skin was without rash , ecchymosis , or petechiae. 
Admission EKG is normal for normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , old T-wave inversions in I and aVL and an isolated ST elevation in lead 2. Notable studies during this admission included CT of the abdomen on admission which showed a new right gluteal hematoma with fluid levels suggesting acute bleed. 
There was no evidence of further hematocrit drop. 
Given that he had been anticoagulated due to right upper extremity DVT and that the indication for anticoagulation in the setting and catheter associated clot is somewhat murky , it was felt that the patient would not benefit from addition of anticoagulation and therefore his Lovenox and Coumadin were discontinued. 
The patient was admitted in August and was known to have three-vessel coronary disease and had underwent stenting of his LAD with a bare metal stent on 6/28/06. 
He will need to have a repeat echocardiogram done in one month's time to assess whether or not he would benefit from an implantable cardiac defibrillator. 
He tolerated slow titration of beta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ACE inhibitor which was felt to be important given his extensive peripheral vascular disease and his low ejection fraction. 
He initially had his antihypertensives to allow for maximal perfusion pressure. 
However , as his coagulopathy resolved , it was felt that the stress that resulted in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptoms was resolved and he was able tolerate , further addition of his antihypertensives without further incident.

Her primary cardiologist is Dr. Kittell HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Bellucci is a 50-year-old woman with coronary artery disease and extensive vascular disease who presented to the ED with worsening chest pain at rest and at baseline has exertional chest pain. 
In the ED , she was noted to be afebrile with a temperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respirations 16 , and satting 98% on 2 liters. 
She was noted on EKG to be in normal sinus rhythm with 2-mm ST depressions in II , III , and aVF V4 through V6. 
She was given aspirin , morphine , metoprolol , Mucomyst , Ativan , nitroglycerin and was made pain-free and was sent to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to the diagonal #1 placed 6/21/04 was no longer patent , as a cause for her unstable angina. 
She had been recently told that no further intervention was possible after her stent to the diagonal #1. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1996 , which involved LIMA to LAD ( free ) and SVG to OM1. Peripheral vascular disease. 
End-stage renal disease status post cadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed. 
IDDM , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , retinopathy , TIA , lower GI bleed , chronic diarrhea , CMV colitis , anemia , and bladder CA , recent diagnosis not yet worked up. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , Ms. Bellucci was taken to the cardiac catheterization suite where it was found that her circumflex was 60% , which had been 60% stenosis , now 100% stenosed. 
Her diagonal #1 status post stent was now 100% stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease was unchanged. 
She had an IBP placed and subsequently an echo was done to rule out effusion and was negative , but had an apparently low EF. 
Following insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump , it was noted that she had absent pulses in her right foot , which was noted also to be cool to touch. 
Her lungs had coarse breath sounds anterolaterally , but without crackles or wheezes. 
She had somewhat decreased bowel sounds , but her belly was soft and nondistended. 
Her bilateral lower extremities were cool with absent pulses in her feet to palpation and her right foot was mottled and was notably cooler without edema. 
She was stable for several days , but on 9/1/04 in the evening experienced an episode of unstable VT arrest requiring shock x 1. no further defibrillation was needed. 
BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular: a. Ischemia: Ms. Bellucci has terrible coronary artery disease and no further intervention can be offered to her after discussion with both Dr. Colasamte 's Surgical team and the EP Service. 
She should not undergo any further catheterizations or revascularization. 
She is not on an ACE or an ARB secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time of this dictation her renal function remains poor and there are no plans to restart an ACE inhibitor or ARB. b. Pump: Ms. Bellucci has ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe MR and she is undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly is getting several liters per hemodialysis session as her blood pressure tolerates. 
Electrophysiology evaluated her for the possibility of an AICD placement , but this has been deferred for now and it is unlikely that she will ever have an AICD placed , certainly not on this hospitalization. 
c. Peripheral vascular disease: Ms. Bellucci has extensive peripheral vascular disease and Vascular Surgery is following her for a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary to ischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump. 
She is having the circumferences of her cath measured once or twice a day and these have not been increasing , have in fact been decreasing. 
Also , her creatinine kinase levels have been followed as a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these have been decreasing and are currently normal. 
She had lower extremity noninvasive Dopplers to evaluate her arterial venous flow and no clot was noted in the venous circulation. 
There was no comment made on the FEM-FEM graft , however , but no note was made of an arterial clot. 
She is continuing on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and she did have one positive UA , but this is not being treated because it is difficult to assess secondary to her extremely concentrated urine , but should be followed if she does produce urine. 
This may be permanent , but it is not clear at this point she may be on hemodialysis indefinitely. 
She is on fluid restriction per renal recommendations of 1000 cc per day intake and her ARB is being held for now. 
It is not clear what the source is. 
She has had two negative HIT antibodies , platelet factor IV antibodies , and her platelets seemed to have stabilized in the high 40s , mid 50s and she is not showing any signs of acute bleed , but this has been communicated with Electrophysiology Service who is aware of the possibility that amiodarone may be causing her thrombocytopenia and the amiodarone has been continued unless her thrombocytopenia worsens significantly. 
It was noted to be transudative. 
She was caught and did not fall , but the pleural effusion was not completely drained and she developed a small hydropneumothorax. 
She also had a CT subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there was no evidence of that. 
There has been no compromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and this should be followed since it will likely reaccumulate after tapping , but if she becomes more symptomatic it should be tapped. 
For her diabetes , she is on NPH and an insulin sliding scale. 
7. She experienced an increase in her LFTs , her transaminases bumped to several 100s , and her total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 , her alkaline phosphatase also bumped , however , this may have been secondary to the starting Lipitor and this was discontinued. 
It is not clear exactly the source of her increase in LFTs. 
She was on Zocor as an outpatient and we hope that this is not a class effect and that it is not going to be related to the dose of her Zocor.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Beckfield is a 68-year-old dutch speaking man with a known history of coronary artery disease , who was in his usual state of health until August , 1999 when he began to developed right upper quadrant pain , and was seen by his primary care physician and sent to the emergency room with a diagnosis of possible early acute cholecystitis. 
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service at Pagham University Of , but managed medically without a operative procedure with antibiotics including ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl. 
The quality of the patient's right upper quadrant pain was noted as sharp and constant with nausea but no vomiting , fevers , chills , back pain , or urinary symptoms. 
The pain lasted several hours postprandially and had no radiation. 
In addition , the patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath. 
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. 
MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. ( 2 ) Lisinopril 40 milligrams q.d. ( 3 ) Mevacor 40 milligrams q.d. ( 4 ) Insulin NPH subcutaneous 50 units q.a.m. ( 5 ) Regular insulin subcutaneous 10 units q.a.m. ( 6 ) Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. chest pain. 
( 7 ) Atenolol 50 milligrams q.d. 
He has minimal alcohol use and , in fact , has not drank alcohol since 1984. 
BACK: Back has no costovertebral angle tenderness. 
Right upper quadrant tenderness and guarding but no rebound , and no Murphy's sign. 
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis , clubbing or edema. 
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 62 with no signs of acute ischemia. 
He was made n.p.o. , and hydrated with intravenous fluids and started on triple antibiotics including ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl. 
The patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood count throughout his hospital course on the Surgical Service. 
The patient then underwent ERCP on March , 1999 , where a distal common bile duct stone was noted , and an attempt at removal of the stone was made. 
However , the stone could not be extracted. 
Repeat ERCP showed that there was no residual stone , and no additional stones were noted. 
The patient was then advanced on his diet , which he tolerated with no further symptoms. 
The patient continued to be followed by the Surgical Service who recommended , then , an elective cholecystectomy as an outpatient at a later date. 
( 2 ) Cardiovascular: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease , a cardiology consult was obtained by the Surgical Service , who then continued to follow the patient once he was transferred to the Medical Service. 
Preoperative evaluation for possible cholecystectomy was performed , and it was noted that the patient's coronary artery disease included the following history: The patient had a coronary catheterization in 1995 , which revealed a 30 percent left anterior descending artery , proximal as well as mid stenosis , as well clean circumflex , 70 to 90 percent obtuse marginal lesion , and a 40 percent , 40 percent , and 70 percent serial right coronary artery lesions , as well as a 70 percent posterior descending artery lesion. 
In January 1996 , the patient had an exercise tolerance test , in which the patient went six minutes and 30 seconds with 1 millimeter ST depressions , which were highly predictive of ischemia , but the patient had no symptoms , and he refused intervention at that time. 
The cardiology consult concluded that given the patient's history of coronary artery disease , a recommendation was made to perform a nuclear imaging study to assess the patient's ischemic risk for a cholecystectomy. 
However , moderate to severe inferoapical ischemia was noted on MIBI images. 
He was continued on medications , which included Lopressor , lisinopril , and Diltiazem. 
Persistent hypertension was controlled by increasing the dose of beta blocker with good response. 
Aspirin was held secondary to consideration of ERCP and the possibility of gastrointestinal bleed. 
Given that the patient remained symptom free from a cardiac standpoint , cardiology consult decided that the patient's cardiac catheterization would be deferred until after this hospitalization , in light of the possible complications of adding a TB3A antagonist during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the context of possible ERCP. 
( 3 ) Endocrine: The patient's diabetes was well controlled with his insulin regimen , which was held while he was n.p.o. , as well as on an insulin sliding scale. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. ( 2 ) NPH insulin subcutaneous 50 units q.a.m. ( 3 ) Regular insulin subcutaneous 10 units q.a.m. ( 4 ) Lisinopril 40 milligrams p.o. q.d. ( 5 ) Nitroglycerin 1 tablet sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain. 
( 6 ) Procardia XL 90 milligrams p.o. q.d. ( 7 ) Atenolol 50 milligrams p.o. q.d. 
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with the surgery clinic for scheduling of elective cholecystectomy on October , 1999 , as well as follow up with cardiology for an elective catheterization.

She began to describe shortness of breath , and took her inhalers which did not help. 
She was started on Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma. 
General , this is an agitated woman in no acute distress. 
The abdomen was benign , no hepatosplenomegaly noted. 
The extremities showed no edema , with intact distal pulses. 
Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented times three with no focal deficits , but careful neurologic examination was impossible due to severe agitation and anxiety. 
However , with no other etiology present , we were worried about the patient having had tachyarrhythmia from some other source causing this. 
They also suggested prednisone , but the patient did refuse this. 
Therefore , the final etiology for the patient's flash pulmonary edema was amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis causing increased susceptibility to tachyarrhythmia , left ventricular hypertrophy , and possible diastolic dysfunction , resulting in acute pump dysfunction , causing flash pulmonary edema. 
Her white count fully resolved and she had no fever or other symptoms of pneumonia. 
She will be discharged without any further antibiotics. 
We will continue this and allow outpatient follow-up to determine whether or not she will need this in the future.

NECK: Supple and there was no lymphadenopathy , his jugular venous distention was absent , an EJ line was in place , and there was a 2+ carotid with zero bruits. 
ABDOMEN: Examination showed positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , and non-distended. 
A transthoracic echo obtained upon admission showed the aortic valve was in place , there was a 2.9 meters per second flow through the aortic valve , and there was no abscess or vegetation noted. 
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , no infiltrate , and no congestive heart failure and his EKG at admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 89 with an axis of minus 20 , intervals were 0.26/0.90/0.36 , there was a flipped T in lead I , aVL , V5 , and V6 , and there was first degree AV block. 
Therefore , the number one problem was to rule out endocarditis. 
It was judged that a TE would not change our treatment for this gentleman and it was not obtained. 
An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained and Infectious Disease recommended observing the patient on antibiotics for an extra 24 hours before deeming him non-bacteremic and then to observe the gentleman off antibiotics for 24 hours before discharging him. 
It was judged that the patient actually became weak and went down on all fours controlling his fall without actual syncope. 
Final issue was the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
Patient was not discharged on any antibiotics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , hypertension , CHF , and COPD who was admitted on 2/21/05 after presenting to the emergency department complaining of three weeks of feeling unwell. 
Approximately two weeks prior to the admission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement in her symptoms. 
Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin for Coag-negative staph bacteremia. 
The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed no new intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. 
We continued management of her ischemia with aspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. 
The patient was noted to have two positive cultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and one drawn on 5/29/05. 
However , on further review of the sensitivity , we conclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negative staph species. 
This showed severe diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but no renal artery stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sotos is a 58-year-old female status post stent to her left circumflex coronary artery three months prior to admission , with a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , who presents with left jaw pain for the last several days. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post left circumflex stent in April 2002. 
Anxiety , depression , left arm phlebitis associated with blood draws after her left circumflex stent was placed. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a daughter who works for Tysvillei Medical Center She does not smoke nor does she drink alcohol. 
The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization after she was admitted. 
Her cardiac catheterization was on April , 2003. 
Later that afternoon on April , 2003 , she went for cardiac catheterization. 
The cath revealed a right dominant system with no significant left main lesions , no significant left anterior descending lesions , 70% diffuse lesion in the left circumflex artery consistent with instant restenosis of her previously placed PIXEL stent. 
At that point , her hematoma was marked and it was noted to be stable from that point on , no longer expanding beyond the bounds of the marks. 
Vascular surgery saw the patient and felt that as long as the patient's hematocrit stabilized , she would not need any surgical intervention. 
They could not find any evidence for left upper extremity compartment syndrome at that time. 
Further family history was obtained from the patient that day which revealed history suspicious for possible bleeding disorder including the information that the patient's daughter bleeds heavily with each menstrual period , and that both the patient and her daughter have very easy bruising with history of several hematomas secondary to light trauma. 
The patient also reported that she had heavy bleeding with childbirth that required extra hospitalization although it did not require a transfusion. 
From that point onward , the patient did quite well and was maintained on aspirin , beta-blocker , Zocor and ACE inhibitor. 
The remainder of her hospitalization was uncomplicated and after the patient had a stable hematocrit for several days without any recurrent jaw pain , she was discharged home on January , 2003. 
Given the patient's complications with hematoma and bleeding , a head CT was obtained that afternoon to rule out intracerebral hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Davalos is a 36-year-old woman with very poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and extensive end organ damage including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , right eye blindness , lower extremity neuropathy , gastroparesis and a history of extensive infections including VRE line sepsis , MRSA , abdominal abscesses and chronic dermal ulcers. 
She was transferred from Norap Valley Hospital on 1/24/06 in DKA in the setting of a right thigh burn and possible infection. 
She was given a prescription for antibiotics , which she did not fill. 
The area of swelling in her right leg did not spread from the original blister area all the way up to her groin and grossly became more tender and warm. 
Of note , in going to the emergency room , she missed her regular hemodialysis. 
In the Norap Valley Hospital Emergency room , the following vital signs were noted. 
At the time of her transfer , she noted left-sided headache , a warm feeling over her right thigh. 
She denied any recent fever , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea. 
She did note that her last bowel movement was three days prior to admission. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Poor controlled type 1 diabetes. 
12. Personality disorder , deemed not to have capacity - guardian is Earlean Julias # 942-235-3140.

Codeine , erythromycin beef , poke and insulin all caused unknown reactions. 
She denies tobacco use or alcohol use. 
She denies any illegal drug use. 
Per court order , the patient does not have capacity to make medical decisions. 
Visible old peritoneal dialysis site with serosanguinous drainage and granulation , otherwise noninflamed and nontender. 
NOTABLE LABS: Sodium 133 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 19 , BUN 47 , creatinine 8.3 , calcium 8.5 , magnesium 2.1 , phosphate 2.9 , anion gap 15 , ALT 84 , AST 186 , alk phos 264 , T. bili 1.0 , troponin less than assay , BNP 4900 , amylase and lipase normal , serum osms 337 , lactate 4.7 , WBC 5.3 , hematocrit 31.6 , platelets 208 , 000 , INR 1.3. 
EKG normal sinus rhythm at 74 , normal axis , normal intervals , no ischemia , no peak T-waves. 
Echo in September 2006 , mild LVH , EF 65% to 70% , no wall motion abnormalities , mildly enlarged right ventricle , normal RV outflow tract , mild left atrial enlargement , mild right atrial enlargement , mild aortic stenosis , trace mitral regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressure of 48 , IVC dilated with diminished respirophasic variation consistent with markedly elevated right atrial pressure. 
Causes of DKA that were ruled out included the following - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreatic enzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. 
The patient's DKA was presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in the setting of a local burn. 
She initially was given 500 mL normal saline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. 
Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take both her long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. 
As a result , an endocrinology consult was called. 
The patient was noted to be ordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explain her labile sugars. 
Endocrinology continues to leave recommendations about AC standing insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale and Lantus insulin. 
The patient has a history of gastroparesis and therefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. 
The patient's new covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology. 2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentin and IV vancomycin. 
The underlying skin is pink with evidence of good granulation and no further evidence of infection. 
She should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless she has evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. 
4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chest pain. 
The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. 
Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence of right heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspect of the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejection fraction. 
We did not know her dry weight. 
Her hypertension has been somewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continued on her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched to Captopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time. 
Rhythm , normal sinus rhythm. 
The patient is currently on telemetry with no signs of arrhythmia. 5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on a cardiac , renal and diabetic diet. 
She was noted to repeatedly order extra food from the kitchen supervisor. 
Nutrition endocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are working diligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000 calories per day as specified by her ADA diet. 
ADDENDUM Of note , on the night of 10/22/06 , the patient complained of severe cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. 
She noted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea. 
Several C. diff studies , which were sent recently have been negative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.

In summary , the patient's three-vessel run off to the left lower extremity indicated that she would not likely need a bypass for wound healing at this time. 
There were multiple attempts to save a stool specimen; either the patient did not save the stool at times or it was mixed with copious amounts of urine. 
The patient was seen by the Diabetes Management Service for evaluation of her diabetes as her blood sugars were elevated on her admission regimen.

The patient's hospital course by systems , Neurological: The patient remained intact with no focal deficits , however , the patient experienced dysphasia due to his tonsil cancer status post XRT , failing speech and swallow and finally requiring a PEG placement for nutritional support. 
Cardiovascular: The patient was status post a maze procedure and initially was paced and found to be in a junctional rhythm at 60 then recovery of normal sinus rhythm , however , postoperatively had gone into a rate controlled atrial fibrillation requiring low-dose beta-blocker as well as anticoagulation. 
However , he did see few episodes of sinus rhythm and currently on discharges in sinus rhythm and rate controlled on low-dose beta-blocker. 
There was no pericardial effusion found and patient will be discharged on low-dose beta-blocker as well as anticoagulation. 
His discharge chest x-ray shows no evidence consolidation and mild atelectasis at the left base , no pulmonary edema noted. 
The patient also was closely followed by the speech and swallow team and due to his dysphagia status post squamous cell carcinoma resection of his left tongue and XRT , patient continues to have dysphasia , unable to protect his airway and by postoperative day #14 underwent a PEG placement and now at goal of 70 mL per hour to see if he is tolerating without any problems. 
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout his postoperative course , was on Lasix for diuresis postop without no elevation in his creatinine.

She had a previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. 
She now presents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip , denying any change in her cough or sputum production although she did note a slightly increased temperature. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Was remarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 ) borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis , ( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis , ( 9 ) obesity. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy in 1979 , status post back surgery. 
There is no alcohol use. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obese female in no acute distress. 
Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention. 
Heart: Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Extremities: 2+ edema to her calves bilaterally , no clubbing. 
The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with no infiltrates. 
She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone to cover a possible tracheobronchitis. 
There was a question whether or not her urinary tract infection was adequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000 colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. 
This last culture on 5/17/93 was associated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. 
Because of this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that it was necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cath specimen was obtained. 
This was at a point when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had an element of essential sleep apnea. 
She also during periods of non-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstruction and not breathing at all. 
This revealed that she also has a component of obstructive sleep apnea as well. 
There were no complications.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He is an 81-year-old man primarily Russian-speaking , with a history of multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease status post an MI in 2004 as well as a cath at the same time with percutaneous intervention , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45-50% , atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and a partial pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome , multiple strokes x4 , diabetes mellitus type 2 and COPD , who was recently admitted to the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of for bacteremia with Streptococcus oralis without a clear source. 
He has peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , COPD but not reported to be on any home oxygenation , dementia , Paget disease , atrial fibrillation , BPH , congestive heart failure , EF of 45-50% , hypertension , diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included the following: Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , metformin 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x10 days which was started on 5/5/06 , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. , nystatin suspension q.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q. h.s. , Penicillin G 3 million units IV q. 4h x7 days , Milk of Magnesia , Tylenol p.r.n. , Dulcolax p.r.n. , Colace p.r.n. , atenolol 50 mg q. day , Lipitor 20 mg q. day , Senna liquid q. h.s. , Flomax 0.4 q. day. 
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies. 
In general , he was in no acute distress in restraints. 
He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
He was afebrile at the time of admission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis given his blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids and antibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. 
A TEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was going to be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. 
All blood , urine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth to date at the time of discharge. 
2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated some apnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP; however , given the fact that the patient was a significant aspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possibly would increase the risk of aspiration. 
His repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likely indicates a chronic process. 
A plan was made to not reinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. 
His enzymes were negative on this admission and a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. 
The patient was restarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2 pump. 
Hypotension improved on admission , restarted his beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the time of discharge. 
5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did not demonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. 
The patient has responded very nicely to this and is no longer agitated. 
In general , he is in no acute distress. 
His rate and rhythm were regular without murmurs. 
His extremities are without edema.

The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in his sputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen for him. 
The patient denies any associated fevers or chills. 
The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount not documented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has not had any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ). 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in 1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ). 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
3. Status post coronary artery bypass graft. 
The patient is an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
JVP was approximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. 
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese , nontender , and nondistended. 
The Infectious Disease team recommends that the patient's repeat AFBs be followed up and , if they are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could be stopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy.

Status post cholecystectomy. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 66-year-old female with severe diabetes mellitus type II , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , peripheral vascular disease , COPD , asthma , and history of multiple infections who presents with bilateral lower extremity area edema , swelling , and pain. 
She had no fever but did have chills , no shortness of breath or cough , wheezing , no dizziness or orthostatic symptoms. 
She had had an abdominal CT during that admission for left upper quadrant pain , which demonstrated no evidence of splenic infarct. 
In the ED on this admission , she was afebrile , her vital signs were stable , she was started on levofloxacin , and she had plain films of her right foot , which were consistent with evidence of chronic versus acute osteomyelitis of the second toe. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems , she denied any chest pain , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and her fingerstick , she mentioned , had been running high , to the 250s on prednisone. 
With Linezolid , she gets headaches and hypertension , with Vancomycin hives , Ultram produces systemic reaction of unclear nature , and to Keflex her allergy is questionable because she has tolerated cephalosporins and penicillins in the past by report of the admitting team. 
Cardiac: She had a regular rate , distant heart sounds on her cardiac examination but no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
She also had an ulcer on the plantar surface of the left extremity , which was not fluctuant but did have serosanguinous drainage and erythema that was circumferential to the mid-shin. 
She also had some left calf tenderness with a questionable palpable cord. 
There was not right calf tenderness that was noted. 
Neurological: Neurological was grossly intact and there were no focal deficits noted. 
She had an MRI of the lower extremities bilaterally , which demonstrated no collections but was notable for acute osteomyelitis of the left 2nd and 3rd metatarsal as well as chronic osteitis of the calcaneous wounds. 
The right phalanges were not visualized well. 
A TTE on 2/21/2003 was negative for any vegetation. 
She also complained of sternal discomfort , dysphasia , and oral thrush on examination , and it was felt that she likely had oral candidiasis secondary to her steroid course and so she was started on Diflucan as well as on a nystatin swish and swallow. 
On 3/19/2003 , the Diflucan was discontinued and she was continued on nystatin swish and swallow for the oral candidiasis , which has since been improving. 
She had an increase in her LDH but no schistocytes were notable on smear. 
She was transfused successfully without any complications or transfusion reactions and her hematocrit at the time of discharge is 36.0. 3. Pulmonary: The patient's prednisone taper was discontinued on day 4 because of oral candidiasis. 
She has had no acute COPD exacerbations but has had increased shortness of breath periodically , which has been improved with nebulizer treatments. 
At this time , the CT scan was reviewed to ensure that there was no fracture of the ribs as she did have tenderness in the left lower lung field area. 
However , the ribs were visualized well and there was no evidence of any fracture. 
She had intermittent chest pain without EKG changes , possibly secondary to esophageal spasm , which was relieved by nitroglycerine. 
The decision was made , however , to go ahead with the surgery for her feet with spinal block , not with general anesthesia. 
It was felt that the cardiovascular plan in terms of her coronary artery disease should be to increase her exercise tolerance during rehab to the point where she may begin to experience symptoms and then cap at that time can be considered. 
The patient has a history of vitreous hemorrhages and questionable retinal detachment in the past. 
They have been trending down since she is status post cholecystectomy and was initially very tender in her right upper quadrant. 
Her right upper quadrant ultrasound on 10/19/2003 was negative except for an enlarged liver alkaline phosphatase that was thought to be secondary to osteomyelitis.

4. High blood pressure , chronic hypertension. 
Given evidence of an IUFD and possible fetal distress in twin #2 , she was brought for a stat cesarean section which was ultimately complicated by multiple factors. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Chronic hypertension. 
Postoperative diagnoses were listed as chorioamnionitis , diabetes , and demise of twin #2. 
There were no complications. 
The impression of her positive cardiac enzymes that did trend downwords was that it was secondary to the aggressive chest compressions and were felt not likely to lead to significant myocardial injury. 
Of note , throughout her MICU admission , she was tachycardic to 120s to 140s , and this was ascribed to her marked amounts of postpartum hemorrhage in the setting of possible chorioamnionitis with sepsis. 
This tachycardia resolved by postoperative day #6 , and by postoperative day #12 , she was no longer tachycardia with a heart rate in the 80's. 
This controlled her hypertension throughout the remainder of her hospital course , and she was discharged home on labetalol. 
A hematology consult was obtained to evaluate the possible causes of her low platelets , and she underwent an extensive evaluation including a negative anticardiolipin and a negative lupus anticoagulant. 
In the setting of a normal nonobstructive picture , the GI consult had the impression that the increased bilirubin was secondary to her shock liver as well as the multiple blood transfusions and possible sepsis. 
GI was again reconsulted and had the impression that she did not suffer from pancreatitis given that she had no nausea or vomiting , was tolerating a regular diet , and had resolved abdominal pain. 
They felt that this was likely secondary to post-surgical change and was not an aggressive process that may need further treatment. 
An abdominal pelvic CT also demonstrated a normal pancreas without any evidence of stranding or pseudocyst formation. 
This diagnosis is one that can be best made by a liver biopsy and discussions with the GI Service revealed that they did not feel strongly that she needed a liver biopsy. 
It was unclear as to whether or not she had acute fatty liver of pregnancy , but given the risk of recurrence , she will be counseled as an outpatient with regard to future pregnancies and management of these pregnancies , given her history of potential acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
This was concerning for a possible subcutaneous hematoma. 
So an abdominopelvic CT was obtained on postoperative day #10 that showed evidence of an 8 x 5 cm right rectus hematoma that may have had an area of tracking through the fascia into the subcutaneous space. 
She had a T-Max of 101.9 in the Medical Intensive Care Unit , and ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin as well as levoflox ofloxacin were started on IV and was continued for 6 days until ultimately her blood cultures grew out no organism. 
The urine cultures were negative and her placenta culture also demonstrated only staphylococcus coagulase negative with a Gram's stain showing no organisms. 
She remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course and was not discharged on antibiotics. 
This was perplexing as she was known to be type 2 diabetic who initially been managed on metformin prepregnancy. 
The concern was for possible addisonian crisis and cord stimulation test was normal as well as a.m. and p.m. cortisol levels were checked. 
These remained within normal limits , and the concern for possible Sheehan syndrome secondary to her massive postpartum hemorrhage was largely excluded. 
A head CT was obtained postoperative day #4 , and this was shown to have no focal abnormalities although there was some indication that there might have been some stranding between the white and gray matter consistent with possible edema. 
She was offered home physical therapy but declined as she thought the visiting VNA would be adequate and that she was able to be out of bed with her usual exercise tolerance. 
She will have daily VNA dressing changes and was instructed to call if she had any fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , increased bleeding from the incision or if she had any questions.

He had cardiac catheterization at Pagham University Of on August , 1999 which demonstrated a 30% tapering lesion of the left main coronary artery , 70% proximal lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery , 80% lesion distal to D1 , 100% occlusion of his left circumflex and a 100% occlusion of his right coronary artery. 
He is admitted on March , 1999 for coronary artery bypass grafting. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Psoriasis and polymyalgia rheumatica , coronary artery disease and wide eye glaucoma. 
Chest x-ray revealed no acute disease. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On May , 1999 , he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the aorta and a saphenous vein graft from the obtuse marginal to the aorta. 
He was again extubated and was seen in consultation by the Gastrointestinal Service for a question of gastrointestinal bleed since there was a clot seen on the transesophageal echocardiogram probe at its withdrawal from his first surgery.

IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 71 year old gentleman with a history of severe coronary artery disease who presented with unstable angina with probable mesenteric ischemia. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , remote history of smoking , questionable positive family history , and no diabetes mellitus. 
The patient has had a history of coronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardial infarctions. 
The patient was given Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
Since then , the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of health without any chest pain for the two years until about three days prior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain , epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for 4-6 hour episodes. 
He denied orthopnea , PND , edema. 
The patient's pain was similar to but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. 
The patient denied chest pain. 
He received Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary to increased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequently improved. 
His EKG had T wave inversions in V5 through V6. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for coronary artery disease as above. 
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , nondistended. 
Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Room revealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladder stones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , low volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. 
The patient did very well after that and his troponin level at that point was 0. The patient's CPKs were recycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again. 
His ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness of breath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis he was able to be on room air without any difficulty. 
It was therefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization. 
He did not achieve target heart rate. 
It was decided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior to consideration for surgery. 
The patient remained chest pain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.

RECORD #1000
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 79 year old Russian speaking female who had had a history of exertional chest pain and no previous documented coronary artery disease. 
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. 
Patient was continued on Atenolol , however , given her history of symptomatic bradycardia , her dose could not be increased. 
This was usually experienced in the late morning with no obvious relation to exertion usually accompanied by light headedness. 
On the day of admission , patient awoke without pain , however , in the a.m. , she again noted onset of substernal chest pressure associated with light headedness. 
The patient fell on her right hip without evidence of head trauma with brief loss of consciousness. 
She denied any significant shortness of breath , fever , chills , and sweats. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes times twenty years , status post pancreatectomy , IHSS , and angina. 
There was no significant use of alcohol or tobacco. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was a pleasant elderly female in no acute distress. 
HEENT: Examination was notable for anisocoria , right pupil status post previous surgery , and oropharynx clear without lesions. 
NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , carotids were without bruits , and firm mobile mass on anterior neck. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was non-focal. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: CBC showed a hematocrit of 43.1 , white blood count 8.6 , platelets 160 , electrolytes within normal limits with a potassium of 4.7 , BUN/creatinine 34/0.9 , liver function tests within normal limits , INR 1.1 , and CK 68. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.006 , pH 5.5 , and 1+ bacteria , chest x-ray with evidence of tortuous aorta but no acute pulmonary or cardiac disease , and ECG showed a sinus rhythm , left ventricular hypertrophy , early repolarization in V1 to V3 , T wave inversion in lead I , first degree AV block , otherwise with normal intervals , and axis minus 39. HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 79 year old female with a history of IHSS and insulin dependent diabetes who now presented with a syncopal episode accompanied by substernal chest pressure. 
As a result , the patient's beta blocker dose was increased as tolerated with close monitoring for possible bradycardia. 
It was felt that the patient would benefit from placement of a permanent pacemaker which would possibly be therapeutic both for IHSS as well as allowing further titration of beta blocker for her exertional angina. 
The procedure was discussed with the patient and her family in detail and her family requested one additional evening to discuss whether or not to proceed with pacemaker placement. 
On 3/7/96 , the patient underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker , mode DDDR , via her left axillary vein without complication. 
In addition , she was instructed to check the incision site for sign of redness as well as fever and she was told not to shower for four days status post pacemaker placement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old female with known coronary artery disease , CRF , and history of flash pulmonary edema , recently admitted to Nessinee Ker Hospital Medical Center on 6/9/97 after sudden onset of shortness of breath unrelieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin. 
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
The patient was also recently admitted one month ago to Bussadd Southrys Community Hospital for flash pulmonary edema without evidence of myocardial infarction. 
During vigorous rehydration following that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrent pulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weaned following diuresis. 
On this admission , she denies any chest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. 
She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with the exception of her current presentation. 
The patient's coronary risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , post menopausal status without hormone replacement therapy , and history of tobacco use. 
She has had no other chemo or radiation treatment. 
4. Depression. 5. Hypercalcemia ( no alkalized syndrome ) 9/13 6. History of recurrent pneumonia. 
9. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed one year ago , diet controlled. 
Status post bilateral knee replacement. 
She has no complaints of dysuria or cough. 
Carotids were 1+ without bruits , no thyromegaly , and no lymphadenopathy. 
Her abdomen was slightly distended with no hepatosplenomegaly. 
She had 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally without bruits and 2+ DP pulses bilaterally. 
There was no ankle edema. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was much improved after successful diuresis with improvement of her pulmonary examination and no evidence of right sided failure. 
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient denies ever having had any chest pain , but had known anatomy with single vessel disease ( RCA ). 
Her history is suggestive of possible silent ischemia consistent with her diabetic status. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 6/2/97 with PTCA plus stent placement to her RCA with a good result. 
The day following cardiac catheterization , her hematocrit and creatinine remained stable at 30.9 and 3.7 , respectively. 
This increase was thought to be due to a combination of prerenal insult in addition to possible dinephropathy. 
3. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Etiology was unknown , possibly secondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertensive nephropathy. 
In reviewing the hospital records , there is no evidence of previous work up for renal artery stenosis. 
This patient with history and physical to control blood pressures and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension may benefit from further evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS/PROBLEM LIST: Coronary artery disease status post three vessel CABG in 1981 , hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertriglyceridemia , status post total hip replacement in 1990 , status post cholecystectomy , status post triple hernia repair. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raycraft is a 71-year-old white gentleman who has a history of coronary artery disease , status post CABG in 1981 at the Pagham University Of who was transferred from Docdrew University Hospital with unstable angina for further evaluation and treatment. 
The patient's coronary risk factors include insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension , age , male gender , remote tobacco smoking and also known coronary artery disease. 
The patient has been in his usual state of health active in the Rina Cou Gasler until he noticed progressive chest pain with chest tightness and shortness of breath , but no light-headedness , nausea or vomiting which has been progressing over the past few months. 
The patient did not occur at rest , but occurred with minimal exertion. 
At that time his CKs were stable and his EKG did not show any infarction. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient at this time denies any shortness of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea orthopnea or dyspnea on exertion. 
After the catheterization , the patient was admitted to the Cardiology Seypanard Vi Bend Team where he continued to be heparinized and supported with rate control awaiting a second cardiac catheterization which was to correct the distal LAD lesions. 
The patient had an unremarkable hospital course and underwent his second cardiac catheterization and PTCA on 10/15/97 which resulted in the two distal LAD lesions which were each 90%.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75 year old with a long history of coronary artery disease who presents with unstable angina. 
1980 - coronary artery bypass graft with porcine mitral valve replacement. 
1991 - Repeat coronary artery bypass graft because of recurrent angina , LIMA to LAD graft. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Elderly , moderately obese man in no current distress. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CCU and was taken to the Cardiac Cath Lab with cardiac catheterization as detailed above. 
The decision at that time was made that his findings were not amenable to angioplasty or to surgical intervention. 
He was seen by the cardiac surgery team and they did not feel he was amenable to revascularization. 
On 8 of June the patient was successfully weaned from intra-aortic balloon pump and did not have further chest pain at that time. 
After this event , the angioplasty team was reconsulted concerning the possibility of addressing some of the patient's cardiac lesions. 
He began to ambulate in his room and subsequently around the Cape A Tempe without chest pain. 
He continued throughout final week of hospitalization to have one episode of chest pain on awakening , always relieved with 1 SL nitroglycerin and occasionally relieved without any nitroglycerin. 
On 24 of April , the patient was in good condition without angina , walking around the Cho Lu Cordafranfordette and scheduled to be transferred to Nemode Gatu Memorial Hospital He has also undergone anticoagulation with Coumadin for his dyskinesis.

HISTORY: A 61-year-old female with a long tobacco history of COPD , and recently diagnosed sleep apnea is admitted with an asthma flare. 
PFT's at that time were reportedly normal , although details are not available at this time. 
In February of 1991 , the patient was diagnosed with "asthma"/COPD and had another rule out MI for dyspnea. 
Thallium showed fixed anterior defects ( although the effects overlying breast tissue cannot be ruled out ). 
Of note , the patient also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea for which she is on nasal CPAP. 
She denies fevers , chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , abdominal pain , cough , rash or joint pain. 
Past medical history , COPD , coronary artery disease status post nonQ-wave MI 1983. 
Status post cholecystectomy. 
There was no thrush. 
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at bases , scant wheezes , no crackles. 
EXTREMITIES: Obese , no marked edema , although difficult to assess secondary to obesity. 
Chest X-ray , no significant disease except for a question of mild CHF changes. 
The trigger for her asthma remains illusive. 
She underwent an esophageal acid study to rule out subclinical aspiration ( results pending at the time of discharge ). 
There was no infectious component to her exacerbation detected , although preceding viral illness cannot be excluded. 
On hospital day number four , the patient was converted to Prednisone without complications. 
She had no episodes of chest pain and there was no evidence for ischemic etiology. 
ADDENDUM: Regarding the patient's esophagram results , the patient had a 48-hour esophageal pH monitor which showed that the patient has reflux episodes and parameters which are within normal limits; however , 4/7 cough episodes are correlated with the patient's cough and asthma flares are possibly related to her reflux symptoms; however , the study was not completely diagnostic. 
Benefit from anti-reflux medications such as Reglan on a diagnostic and therapeutic trial , we should also consider further gastroesophageal reflux studies such as manometry as an outpatient.

RECORD #1014
The patient notes that these symptoms have been occurring approximately five times per week over the past two months. 
She has notified her PCP of these events , however , the etiology has never been identified. 
Of note , the patient states that these symptoms have increased in frequency since having two syncopal events , which occurred three days prior to admission. 
There were no antecedent symptoms. 
There was no witnessed seizure activity , no postictal confusion , no tongue trauma nor was there any incontinence. 
The patient denies prior history of syncopal events , however , she does have a lifelong history of seizures and has not been taking her Keppra for approximately a year , as her prescription has ran out and she has failed to keep follow-up appointments with her primary neurologist , Dr. Mateja Both the patient and her daughter note that she usually has postictal confusion and that these syncopal events did not fit that description. 
Furthermore , these episodes did not feel like her occasional hypoglycemic episodes. 
Unfortunately , the patient's blood sugars were not obtained during these syncopal events. 
Of note , the patient recently started Flexeril to treat chronic low back pain. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient admits stable three-pillow orthopnea , but new paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no lower extremity edema , weight loss or increased abdominal girth. 
She has had notable weight loss as she has decreased in dress size from 18-14 over the past nine months. 
She denies fevers or chills. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: HIV positive , drug-seeking behavior , parotitis , migraine headaches , anxiety and panic , depression , hepatitis C , seizures , neuropathy , pancreatitis , abnormal Pap smear , diabetes mellitus , cerebral aneurysm , herpes simplex type 1 , and chronic low back pain. 
ALLERGIES: Compazine , Bactrim , didanosine , gabapentin , cephalosporins , penicillin , clindamycin , stavudine , Tylenol No.3 , levofloxacin , clindamycin , tetanus , IV contrast , ibuprofen , abacavir and ritonavir. 
Her mother had coronary artery disease at age 76. 
She had no oral ulcers or thrush. 
Neck is supple , without cervical lymphadenopathy , no JVD , and no carotid bruits. 
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. 
Abdomen was obese , soft , nondistended , and nontender with questionable splenic fullness , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
Gait was slightly wide-based , but sufficient without cane. 
Negative Romberg , negative pronator drift , and no dysmetria on finger-to-nose bilateral , and deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout. 
ADMISSION DATA: Chest x-ray was within normal limits. 
EKG was normal sinus rhythm without ischemic change. 
CAT scan of the head was within normal limits. 
IMPRESSION: This is a 47-year-old female with a history significant for HIV , diabetes , questionable cerebral aneurysm , and seizure disorder ( not taking Keppra for the past year ) , who recently had two syncopal events without prodrome and without postictal state ( thus unlikely a seizure in etiology ) , who presented for evaluation of left arm paresthesias and chest pain , with associated diaphoresis , shortness of breath and nausea , which has been intermittently occurring over the past two months. 
Thus , the medical team does not think that these two issues are related. 
The etiology of the patient's left arm and chest symptoms and syndromes also was not identified during this admission , however , the medical team suspects it may be related to a cervical spinous process , potentially arthritis , disc herniation or nerve root impingement. 
Echocardiogram that was performed was completely within normal limits. 
The patient did not exhibit signs of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea during this admission. 
b. Rhythm: The patient's telemetry history on 11/8/2006 was notable for a nonsustained 5-beat run of wide complex tachycardia with rates in the 150's. 
This was immediately followed by a nonsustained 4-beat run of narrow complex tachycardia. 
Given the negative echocardiogram , the Card Service wanted to rule out ischemia-induced arrhythmia , so a MIBI was performed , and the patient was started on low-dose beta-blocker and aspirin. 
The adenosine MIBI was within normal limits. 
The telemetry strip was reviewed by the EP Service and diagnosed the patient with nonsustained SVT with aberrancy. 
The Card Service then advised that there was no need for AICD. 
They stated that if tolerated , the beta-blocker could be continued and that the patient should be set up as an outpatient for a loop recorder. 
Of note , after starting metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d. , the patient had occasional bradycardia to the high 40's. 
c. Ischemia: Coronary disease risk factors include diabetes and family history. 
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction , had no ischemic change on her EKG , and had a negative MIBI. 
No further workup for coronary artery disease was indicated. 
A lipid panel was completely within normal limits and suggesting treatment was not indicated. 
The patient was noted to be diaphoretic and complained of nausea and shortness of breath. 
EKG in telemetry during the event was normal sinus rhythm with any acute ST or T-wave changes. 
The event spontaneously resolved in less than 15 minutes without medical intervention. 
2. Neuro: The patient has a history of convulsive seizures and has been noncompliant with Keppra for the past 12 months because she failed to keep neuro appointment with Dr. Wantuck and has been unable to obtain refills. 
Per the patient , her recent syncopal events were without prodrome and without postictal state. 
An EEG was performed during this admission and demonstrated no definite focal or epileptiform features. 
Keppra was restarted at 250 mg b.i.d. with a goal to increase to 500 mg b.i.d. after 7 days and to 750 mg after another week. 
There was a question of a history of cerebral aneurysm , diagnosed at an outside facility , which was never confirmed by Totin Hospital And Clinic imaging. 
MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck obtained this admission was negative for hemorrhage , mass , edema , hydrocephalus , infarction , and negative for abnormal enhancement. 
There was no aneurysm high-flow AVM or stenosis found , and MRA of the neck had no significant abnormality. 
3. Endocrine: History of diabetes type II , hemoglobin A1c of 6.1 , reflects excellent outpatient glycemic control , however , the patient reports becoming diaphoretic with normal glycemic levels between 80 and 100. 
Given recent weight loss without glyburide dose adjustment , the medical team decreased glyburide to 2.5 mg daily for the patient to begin upon discharge. 
No additional regular narcotics were given during this admission. 
She has a normocytic normochromic anemia with normal iron studies , B12 and folate , and a low reticulocyte index consistent with anemia of chronic disease , likely from HIV immunosuppression. 
The patient may have autonomic dysregulation as part of her diabetes. 
Alternatively , the medical team speculates that the patient may have cervical spinal arthritis , lumbar herniation or nerve root impingement contributing to these symptoms. 
Of note , the patient states that these episodes had occurred more frequently inpatient and they were at home. 
It was until the day of discharge that it was noted that the patient was not receiving her Klonopin 1 mg q.i.d. as she had prior to admission. 
In fact , she has only received three doses of Klonopin over a six-day period. 
FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Syncope , not otherwise specified. 
2. Left arm pain/left chest pain/left arm paresthesias ( not otherwise specified ). 
3. Adjust the patient's diabetes management as needed.

Her PMH includes HTN , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA vs. stroke 10/26 ( manifest as slurred speech , left arm and leg weakness ). 
She had a possible patent foramen ovale with agitated saline contrast passage on valsalva maneuver TTE when she was admitted 11/25 for stroke work-up. 
One day prior to admission she saw her PCP who noted hypertension and referred her to an ophthalmologist , who obtained a normal exam by report. 
At present , the patient denies headache and confusion , as well as diplopia , vertigo , dysphagia , and dysarthria. 
She denies recent chest pain , but has had orthopnea.

Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recent headaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inability to walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. 
Neurologic exam was significant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facial weakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right fine finger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait. 
These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosis was felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensive encephalopathy. 
The patient had recent poorly-controlled hypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure including exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. 
An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensive encephalopathy. 
Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate the procedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experience as a prohibitive factor. 
Her blood pressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and she remained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , and weakness. 
Her lipid profile revealed elevated total cholesterol and LDL. 
She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well as supplement her diet with folic acid. 
She has an outpt appointment for carotid non-invasive studies 10/25/03. 
She should also discuss raising her dose of atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDL were elevated this admission.

She was transferred from the Siscate Nor Hospital to the Pagham University Of HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old lady with diabetes and known coronary artery disease status post CABG and status post multiple PCIs. 
Her past medical history was relevant for the following: She had diabetes type 2 with chronic renal insufficiency secondary to the diabetes. 
She had coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1992. 
She also had congestive heart failure with an EF per an echo performed at Siscate Nor Hospital was 35%. 
She had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. 
She had osteoarthritis with both knees. 
She had spinal stenosis and chronic back pain status post cholecystectomy and a history of asthma. 
She is alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. 
Her heart had a regular rate and rhythm with no gallop. 
Her extremities are warm with no edema and she is grossly neurologically intact. 
She was managed medically , not interventionally given her acute renal failure. 
After five days , she had no recurrent chest pain. 
The plan is for her to continue on aspirin , Plavix , high-dose Lipitor , and beta-blocker , and nitrates as needed. 
She did not have a low urine output and she had received amikacin in the past few days prior to admission as well as contrast dye and she did have a history of contrast dye induced nephropathy leading to a predialysis state , although she did not get dialysis on that occasion. 
Here , we simply avoided nephrotoxic agents , were judicious in the use of Lasix with strict ??____?? controls , and her creatinine gradually began to decrease and today it is down to 1.6. 
Blood cultures drawn on the 24 of April showed no growth to date. 
In terms of her hypertension , of note , it has been difficult to measure her blood pressure , probably measuring her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation is a most reliable way to do this. 
Today , she told me that she has not filled this for a long time. 
She had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath. 
She is alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. 
Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no gallops , rubs , or murmurs. 
Studies performed at this hospital include the following: A renal ultrasound as part of her workup for acute renal failure reveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical cortical cyst , left kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis. 
The patient also had a MIBI , SPECT of her heart , which revealed the following: The combined ??____?? ischemia plus scar during the stress were moderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9. Her rest LV ejection fraction was 50%.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension , LVH , and heroin use , who presented with shortness of breath times several weeks which was sometimes associated with chest pain. 
The patient noted that the shortness of breath was often brought on by heroin use ( He has not used cocaine for several years. 
It was not necessarily worse when lying flat. 
His chest pain was hard for him to describe , although , he did mention that it was not heavy in character. 
There was no nausea. 
His pain did not radiate to the neck or arms and was different from heartburn pain. 
Of note , the patient has not taken his outpatient medications for the last six months and admits to diet noncompliance with salty foods. 
In the past , he has noticed that he cannot go more than two days without symptoms of withdrawal. 
There is no abdominal pain. 
MEDICATIONS: The patient has taken no medications for six months. 
GENERAL: The patient was seated and in no acute distress. 
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 , S2. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
His belly was soft and obese , nontender. 
There were no obvious masses. 
There was no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
EKG on arrival to the emergency room showed an irregular ventricular rate at 156 which was likely atrial fibrillation vs flutter. 
The patient ruled out for MI by CKs but had a troponin which peaked at 0.12. 
Blood pressure control was established with verapamil ( The patient had severe bronchospasms to Lopressor and it was unclear whether it was cardiac asthma or real bronchospastic reaction. 
The patient was initially continued on simvastatin. 
Because of the worry of CHF , ( History of low EF , possible orthopnea ) an echocardiogram was performed which showed LVEF only 25% with global hypokinesis and inferior/posterior akinesis. 
The etiology of his heart failure was unclear as he had never had a known myocardial infarction in the past. 
A chemical stress test was performed on June , 2003 , and showed no reversible defect but a large inferior scar. 
The patient was subsequently taken to cardiac catheterization to determine whether he had coronary artery disease. 
There was no coronary artery disease on left heart cath. 
His cardiomyopathy was not shown to be ischemic in origin. 
Aspirin and simvastatin were discontinued given lack of coronary artery disease for the sake of simplifying his medical regimen in order to optimize the chance of medical compliance. 
It was noted that the onset of his cough was after his captopril dosing. 
The patient's creatinine was noted to be up to the mid-2s from a baseline in the mid-1s. 
Potential etiologies on admission where thought to be hypertension , gout , heroin use or a low flow during his cardiac arrhythmia on presentation. 
The patient refused Mucomyst in anticipation of his cardiac catheterization. 
There was no hydronephrosis seen. 
Allopurinol was given for his history of gout.

NECK: Supple with 2+ carotid pulses and no bruits. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , obese. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on January , 1996 , where she was noted to have right coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% and distally had 80%. 
The patient was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary artery bypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. 
On March , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descending artery. 
Although the chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , the patient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she had excellent oxygenation on room air. 
Of note the patient was not restarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the 90-100 range. 
Although the patient had been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INR had not reached the therapeutic range. 
The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays as prior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions which were small and were not compromising her respiration at all.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 61 year old female with coronary artery disease ( status post PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker placement. 
Ms. Bartholomeu 's pertinent medical history was significant for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease. 
In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional chest discomfort. 
Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST depression inferolaterally. 
The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20% residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). 
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal descending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Colasamte ). 
Since then , she had done well with no further chest pain. 
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As described in Secondary Diagnoses above. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smoker of one pack per day times thirty years quitting eleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time of divorce.

GENERAL: Energetic white female in no apparent distress. 
HEENT: Extraocular movements intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynx without erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. 
NECK: Supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruits. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with no rubs , gallops , or murmurs. 
ABDOMEN: Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tube scars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) , normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. 
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distal pulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of 3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liver function tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled 7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. 
Chest x-ray showed status post coronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acute air space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 with an axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright in V4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F. HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted for evaluation and management of near syncope. 
Holter monitor had demonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation of beta blocker ( metoprolol ). 
She tolerated the procedure without complication.

The patient has an extensive past medical history of hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulin dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multiple MI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout , schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system , 1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin , beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out with enzymes. 
The patient's attending felt that the patient was a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventions and would not benefit significantly from it. 
Significant events were not observed. 
She was not tender anywhere else in her abdomen. 
Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgical candidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommend a cholecystectomy in the future. 
The major intervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube by Interventional Radiology which was placed on the night of 3/16/04. 
The IR drain will need to be in the patient's gallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient has her elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a later date.

She extubated without problems and remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen saturations in the 90%. 
Her chest tube that was placed on the right side did not drain much fluid over the next few days. 
As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% of the time. 
She had a bedside echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a trace pericardial effusion. 
The clinical response to dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. 
There were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or rest images. 
Her results were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically limited. 
Ms. Fritze has type II diabetes and was on glyburide 5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. 
She continued that therapy as an inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this admission. 
Ms. Fritze has a history of gout , and we were concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive diuresis. 
We continued her colchicine and decreased her allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. 
DISPOSITION: Ms. Fritze will be discharged to home with VNA services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in her joints infected with gout.

Blood glucose of 377 and a chest x-ray without evidence of congestive heart failure or infiltrate. 
A repeat chest x-ray was performed which showed no change when compared to the admission film. 
Given the finding of E-coli in the sputum sample , in addition to the elevated eosinophilia and lack of finding on chest x-ray despite significant findings on chest exam , the possibility of a worm or parasitic disease was raised. 
The patient is from Utjack Drive but had not been there in 8 years. 
In addition , plans were made for her to have PFTs done as an outpatient and plan for chest CT if her symptoms continued without other etiology being discovered. 
She was to finish a full ten day course of antibiotics for presumed bronchitis and to follow up with her primary physician in clinic for further evaluation including PFTs and possible chest CT if symptoms did not abate.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Tylor is a 61-year-old female with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post cardiac transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery disease , rejection x2 , post transplant MVR and TVR , also with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , diabetes mellitus , hypertension and a subacute change in her mental status over the last few months that presented with a clot in her right upper extremity AV fistula. 
Interventional radiology did not perform a thrombectomy of the right upper extremity fistula clot , as the patient's systolic blood pressures were in the 90s , and they were concerned about the patient's change in mental status as she would need conscious sedation for the procedure. 
She was also noted upon admission to have an EKG that displayed an atrial tachyarrhythmia with 2:1 block that was presumed to be atrial flutter. 
The patient denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or palpitations. 
It should be noted however that the patient was not entirely conversant. 
During that admission , the son stated that the patient had an acute change in her mental status such that she did not know who she was or where she was. 
She was not answering questions appropriately. 
The son says that over the last few months , she has become slightly better but definitely not at her baseline. 
He states that she is often disoriented to person and place , although she does answer some questions appropriately. 
The day prior to her admission , the patient's other son visit with her at the Sa Pehall and did not notice any change in her mental status since her discharge. 
Upon questioning the patient , she denies chest pain , abdominal pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , and palpitations. 
Although , she does answer yes and no to some questions , she is not very conversant and does not volunteer any additional information. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy status post heart transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery disease , post-transplant MVR and TVR , and transplant rejection x2. 2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday hemodialysis ). 3. Diabetes mellitus. 
In general , the patient appears slightly cachetic and is in no acute distress. 
She is awake and is occasionally responding to questions but is otherwise not very conversant. 
Her cardiovascular exam is notable for regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no gallops , 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. 
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally on a limited physical exam ( the patient is not inspiring deeply on request ). 
Her right upper extremity graft is without thrill and without bruit. 
There was no evidence for hemorrhage. 
There were no wall motion abnormalities. 
There was no change in this echocardiogram when compared to her echocardiogram from 4/7/04. 
Her CSF had a normal glucose , two white blood cells with lymphocyte predominance , gram stain that did not show any organisms , and cultures that are no growth to date. 
The cultures thus far have had no growth to date. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Tylor is a 61-year-old female with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post cardiac transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery disease , post transplant MVR and TVR , and rejection , also with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , hypertension and diabetes mellitus who presented with a right upper extremity fistula clot , new atrial flutter with 2:1 block and a change in her mental status that has been of many months. 
B. Ischemia: There were no active issues , and the patient was maintained on her outpatient regimen of aspirin , statin and Imdur. 
There was no seizure activity. 
An MRI was not completed as the patient has an event monitor in her heart. 
The differential diagnosis for this patient is changed and her mental status still includes depression and pseudodementia , and we are still ruling out infectious etiologies with the CSF studies that are pending at the moment ( although this is unlikely ). 
There were days where she was more conversant and would answer many questions appropriately. 
It does not appear that these periods of increased interaction with staff and family were in any correlation with this patient's hemodialysis. 
4. Endocrinology: The patient has type 2 diabetes on insulin at home. 
An infectious workup did not yield any etiology. 
She has not had an elevation in her white blood cell count , although this may be a result of her immunosuppression. 
Blood cultures from 7/10/04 yielded no growth. 
Urine was not cultured , as the patient is anuric. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Imuran 50 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 5000 units subcutaneously t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.day , Imdur sustained release 30 mg p.o. q.day , Nephrocaps one tablet q.day , sliding scale of lispro insulin , rapamycin 8 mg p.o. q.day , Cartia XT 240 mg p.o. q.day , and Toprol XL 300 mg p.o. q.day.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 51 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction in 1977 , status post coronary artery bypass grafting in 1977 , and myocardial infarction in 1985 , with redo coronary artery bypass grafting at C Enwiram Memorial Hospital , complicated by cardiogenic shock , treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump in 1985. 
Since 24 of November , the patient reported recurrent congestive heart failure with chest pain and a variable bundle branch block requiring pacer placement with a DDD pacer in 1990. 
He had an electrophysiologic study at the time , which was negative for ventricular tachycardia. 
In 1 of January , the patient reported to Put Wathern Hospital with severe congestive heart failure and was transferred to Pagham University Of after treatment for transplant evaluation. 
At Pagham University Of on 3 of March , the patient's work-up included an exercise tolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogram per minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentially open left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts and occluded native vessels. 
The patient went home after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever or chills. 
For 2 days , he had some increased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestive heart failure. 
The patient was readmitted on the night prior to transplantation on 9 of September , for increasing congestive heart failure and Dobutamine treatment. 
ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. 
Neck was supple without adenopathy. 
Extremities showed no edema. 
Rectal examination revealed guaiac negative stool , no mass. 
This was complicated by a descending aortic dissection from the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoral catheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypasses and would not have tolerated aortic bypass. 
The patient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to the protocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies. 
The ascending aorta was not involved. 
After this point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams by mouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of the dissection.

IDENTIFICATION: This is a 63 year old gentleman with diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease who was transferred Osri Medical Center after he had a positive Persantine-Thallium test preoperatively for vascular surgery procedure. 
The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors: Diabetes , history of smoking , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , positive family history. 
This 63 year old gentleman is disabled as a consequence of cardiac and peripheral vascular disease. 
As a result , the patient was transferred to Pagham University Of for further evaluation of his cardiac disease and for cardiac catheterization. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 12 to 15 years with consequence of diabetic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy. 
Status post cholecystectomy in 1981 , Status post laser for diabetic retinopathy. 
However , the patient had no cyanosis. 
The patient had a cardiac catheterization on 15 of July which revealed 60% RCA , 50% lad , 60 to 70% D-1 and 100% distal left circumflex lesion with an ejection fraction of 55%. 
Thus coronary artery disease would not need revascularization prior to peripheral vascular surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 82-year-old female with a prior history of hypertension , diabetes , coronary disease status post CABG and angio interventions. 
She was in her usual state of health until returning from the bathroom at 1 a.m. on the day of admission when she felt weak. 
The patient describes the pain is worse when lying flat and associated with mild shortness of breath and intermittent nausea without vomiting. 
She denies radiation of the pain. 
Of note , the patient has had many recent HTN episodes in the w/associated lightheadedness prompting many visits to the Norap Valley Hospital Emergency Room. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies cough , cold symptoms , fevers , chills , weight changes , changes in vision , numbness , diarrhea , melena or urinary symptoms. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes , coronary disease , CABG x2 with redo sternotomy both in the 1970s and 1990s , peripheral artery disease , renal artery stenosis , status post left renal stent , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , right carotid endarterectomy. 
HOME MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , glyburide 1.25 mg daily , Lasix 20 mg daily , Toprol XL 50 mg daily , Lisinopril 15 mg b.i.d. ( recently increased to this dose while at during her last admission to the P Therford Hospital ) and Lipitor 80 mg daily. 
She denies alcohol or illicit drug use. 
She is in no acute respiratory distress. 
HEENT , normocephalic and atraumatic , anicteric sclerae , mucous membranes are moist. 
Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. 
Abdomen has many old healed scars , no rashes , bowel sounds are positive. 
She is soft , nondistended , nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. 
No clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
Skin is intact without rash. 
Neuro , cranial nerves II to XII intact with no focal deficits. 
ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 108 , CO2 23 , anion gap of 9 , calcium 9 , magnesium 1.8 , total bilirubin 0.7 , BNP 165 , cardiac enzymes were not elevated , white count 6.91 , hematocrit 35.9 , platelets 227. 
Urinalysis was within normal limits. 
A portable chest x-ray was without any evidence of acute pulmonary process. 
There were no acute ST changes. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes. 
Her EKG was abnormal , but unchanged from 1/28 She continued on aspirin , Plavix and Lipitor. 
Fasting lipids did not indicate need for change in statin treatment. 
Her EKG was notable for new flipped Ts in leads V3 and V4 ( which happened to be seen previously during this admission when she had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on 6/3 ). 
A repeat rule out MI has been re-initiated and is currently in progress at the time of this dictation. 
Pump: Echocardiogram at the Norap Valley Hospital on 10/6 revealed normal left ventricle with an EF of 60% , left atrial enlargement , 1-2+ mitral valve regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , and mild pulmonary hypertension ( with pulmonary artery pressure of 43 ). 
Of note , on 10/6 at Norap Valley Hospital the patient had her Lisinopril increased to 15 mg b.i.d. to facilitate better blood pressure control. 
Lisinopril was restarted at a dose reduction of 5 mg b.i.d. and Lasix was restarted on 3/1 in the setting of symptomatic chest pain which began while the patient was receiving a second unit of blood ( see heme below of more details ). 
The current plan is to titrate ACE inhibitor to affect as long as her creatinine does not climb. 
The consulting cardiologist ( Dr. Tyacke ) was notified of the atrial fibrillation and ventricular pause event. 
He recommended no inpatient EP eval this admission because the patient had no further symptomatic pauses. 
It is Dr. Tyacke 's preference for the patient to be started on thromboembolic prophylatic Coumadin ( in the setting of paroxysmals of atrial fibrillation ) and to discontinue the aspirin because of possible bleeding risk on combination aspirin , Plavix and Coumadin. 
Blood Pressure: The cardiologist consultation Dr. Tyacke felt that the chest pain and hypertension symptoms could be consistent with recurrence of renal artery stenosis. 
On 10/27/07 , a Doppler renal ultrasound was notable for significant re-stenosis of the left renal artery. 
The patient an angioplasty and stent was placed without peri-procedure complication aside from the possibility of small blood loss ( as will be described in heme section below ). 2. Hematology: The patient has baseline hypoproliferative normocytic normochromic anemia of chronic disease identified by iron studies. 
Her B12 and folate levels were within normal limits. 
On 11/8 , the patient had a hematocrit drop from 30-26 , but this was considered to be either a lab variant or due to blood loss in her subcutaneous tissue from previous Lovenox injections. 
Lovenox was discontinued and the team decided to use TEDs alone for DVT prophylaxis as the patient was ambulatory. 
The Angio Team advised that there will be no need to pursue imaging to search for source of blood loss unless the patient has further hematocrit drop or unless she develops leg , abdominal and back pain symptoms. 
Because of the patient's history of coronary disease , she was ordered for a 2units a blood. 
She only received one unit of blood because she was symptomatic with hypertension and chest pain when the second bag was hung ( see cardiovascular pump section above ). 
Post-transfusion hematocrit was 30.1 and was felt no further blood would be needed. 
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. 
A change in the patient's creatinine from 7/28/28 was attributed to medication-induced ( likely from recent lisinopril dose increased from last NVH admit , and/or dehydration ). 
The medical team suspects possible cause could be ischemia in the setting of hypertension , as the patient has significant celiac disease that was identified on an MRA obtained at P Therford Hospital in 10/13 All stool studies were negative and as on 9/6 her diarrhea resolved. 
2. Given the significant history of vascular disease and the findings on recent MRA , the team suspects that the patient may have hypertension-induced gut ischemia and microvascular cardiac angina. 
This is preliminary discharge summary and the discharge addendum including discharge medications , final diagnoses and medical followup will need to be dictated at the time of discharge.

RECORD #1049
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Baffa is a 72 year old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath. 
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave changes. 
In 1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was not clear when exactly this happened. 
Sometimes , there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three times a week and was associated with shortness of breath. 
She was quite short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or medication noncompliance. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which she took insulin and checked her sugars at home which ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she had idiopathic drop attacks. 
She got these episodes where her legs fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose consciousness. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly obese African-American woman lying in bed in some mild respiratory distress. 
Her oropharynx was moist , her jugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered crackles at the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was soft and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal examination showed guaiac negative brown stool. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted for catheterization which showed three vessel disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the catheterization in 1997. 
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
She had an echo which showed some element of diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RA but no wall motion abnormalities. 
Therefore , while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood pressure regimen was advanced. 
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d. for further diuresis. 
This was felt to be out of proportion to her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought. 
She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitial lung disease. 
She had pulmonary function tests which were consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from her pulmonary function tests in 1998. 
A pulmonary consultation was obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on room air. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipine extended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and Lasix 20 milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.

This patient had known multivessel coronary artery disease status post angioplasty admitted with six hours of rest chest pain with non-diagnostic EKG changes and initial troponin and CK negative. 
Patient's risk factors include a history of hypertension , prior history of tobacco , non-insulin dependent diabetes , his age , and sex. 
CK initially was 210 and MB was not done. 
Patient did not rule in. 
On 10/23/95 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization with elevated right atrial pressure of 39 and 14 , mildly elevated , and three vessel disease with 70% proximal stenosis of his left anterior descending artery , 90% apical stenosis with 30% stenosis of the left circumflex , and two serial 95% stenoses distally of the left circumflex noted. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization with angioplasty of his mid posterior descending artery with 30% residual stenosis and a small dissection of the inferior margin of the vessel. 
He had non-diagnostic EKG changes but was admitted to the CCU for concern for unstable anginal pattern. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was in no acute distress with a heart rate of 54 , blood pressure 114/78 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturation 97% on four liters. 
On 100 micrograms of nitroglycerin and Heparin , there was no chest discomfort. 
EKG revealed a sinus bradycardia with normal intervals , normal axis , and no new change as compared to old EKG. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: Assessment was that this was basically a 76 year old with known coronary artery disease presenting with unstable angina with no significant troponin or CK values. 
Given his history of recent intervention and coronary artery disease , this appeared consistent with unstable angina. 
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with his CK flat and repeat troponin of 0. He was continued on intravenous Heparin and nitroglycerin in the interval amount of time until he ruled out and his aspirin therapy was decreased down to 81 with simvastatin started. 
The patient was continued on intravenous Heparin and nitroglycerin overnight without any recurrent chest discomfort. 
Post-PTCA , the patient was continued on Heparin overnight without any recurrent chest discomfort. 
There was a issue with this patient of whether his chest discomfort given its atypical nature was cardiac in etiology although he definitely had disease on angiography but he had significant possibility for other etiologies as a source for his discomfort such as cervical radiculopathy with left arm numbness and occasional anterior chest discomfort which he had difficulty distinguishing from any anginal-like discomfort. 
The patient was basically observed 24 hours after his Heparin was stopped , he was restarted on enoxaparin , and continued on aspirin , Captopril , Lopressor , and simvastatin. 
Patient did not have any recurrent chest discomfort in the interim observation and he was discharged home on a stable out-patient regimen. 
As far as his diabetes , he continued on his out-patient Micronase with b.i.d. fingerstick monitoring which was normal.

She had no lymphadenopathy. 
She had a normal S1 , S2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and was found to have a flat JVP on admission. 
She did not have any hepatomegaly. 
Distal pulses were not palpable. 
Pulmonary was consulted and they suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possible postobstructive pneumonia. 
Cultures did not grow anything. 
A followup CT scan was obtained , which showed continued infiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural effusion , no pneumothorax was observed. 
Radiology felt that her consolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and that it was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in fact quite patent and thus it was decided that the patient would continue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup with pulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would be indicated for further workup of this patient's infiltrate with followup imaging to occur as well. 
Two sets of cardiac markers were obtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did not have ischemic event that occurred.

She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevated cholesterol. 
Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours after eating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable if affected by position. 
There were no carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. 
There was an S4. Abdomen - obese with a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. 
Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses. 
There were no effusions or evidence of failure on chest x-ray. 
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support this. 
In the FTTCH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker , aspirin. 
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95 with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 , pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. 
On the 29 of July , the patient had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight diaphoresis. 
Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new murmurs noted on exam. 
Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with these interventions with no radiation in the arm. 
The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate of 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave upright , else no change. 
if the symptoms were to increase , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this patient for recurrent cath. 
There was no remarkable hematoma in the right groin.

There are no skin marks noted at the scene. 
However , he has no recollection of the motor vehicle collision itself , and the next thing he remembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed , and being in severe pain. 
The patient denies any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehicle collision. 
He also denies any fevers , chills , night sweats , shortness of breath , headaches or visual changes either before or after. 
He had no recent changes in any doses of his medications. 
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies. 
The oropharynx is significant for a slight bite mark on the tongue , without any active bleeding. 
The neck is supple , and there is no midline tenderness. 
There is no bony tenderness along any of the long bones of the upper or lower extremities , with exception of the knee. 
There is no dysmetria or dysarthria. 
There is no drift. 
There was also some supraclavicular stranding along the left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. 
He was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without any diverticulitis. 
The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines also demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally noted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. 
He also had an additional Zoll pacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside , however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic with his bifascicular block. 
He had serial enzymes , which were performed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
He went to the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery disease. 
The diffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any abnormality. 
Therefore , given the fact that signal was seen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was felt that this was at least 10 days old. 
Therefore , this was not felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle collision. 
It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was not previously detected. 
Given the fact that the patient remained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and radiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10 days old , and this was not further addressed. 
The MRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left bifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis. 
The right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis , however , could not be completed excluded. 
There was no evidence of fracture. 
With the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute intervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports Medicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. 
In addition , he was noted to have several rib fractures. 
However , he adamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon inspiring. 
4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute infection. 
Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the last two days of admission. 
The chest x-ray was performed on the 17 of August , which demonstrated no infiltrate. 
However , further workup for his white count is not performed at the present time , however , the patient is informed , as the Rehab Hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient seem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be reevaluated by a physician. 
5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any difficulty. 
He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet. 
However , it was noted that he started having increasing white count. 
The knee was obviously a concern for possible infection. 
An arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry tap; no fluid was able to be obtained. 
The EP Service again evaluated the patient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear infection from the pacer site. 
He continued to have no erythema or tenderness around the pacer site. 
Of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on the Ancef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into the approximately 10000 range.

The patient states that over the last several months since October , 2001 , she has noted increasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance. 
She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. 
About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mg p.o. t.i.d. 
On 10/5 she presented to her cardiologist , Dr. Bernas , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema. 
He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what was contributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her on atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. 
Wednesday morning , her second day of atenolol , she noted having episodes where "I felt my heart pause and then surge when it started to beat again". 
This was associated with lightheadedness x several seconds. 
She did not have any associated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting , diaphoresis or syncope. 
She called Dr. Bernas on 6/16 and he told her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. 
Over the last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heart beat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol on Wednesday. 
She has noted increased shortness of breath over the last couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs. 
She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not have PND , does have lower extremity edema. 
On the day of admission which was 10/25/01 Dr. Barnaba received a transmitted Holter recording from Potwood Kinlis Wellscajohns Health Center that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with episodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that she had episodes of 6.6 second pauses. 
Thus , she called the patient and had her sent via ambulance to the I Warho Hospital emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker placement. 
In the emergency department the patient's vitals were she was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 , breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. 
Her review of systems was negative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope , abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. 
In the emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sent to the floor. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a 52-year-old female resting comfortably at 45 degrees , in no acute distress. 
Oropharynx revealed moist mucous membranes , no erythema. 
CHEST: Wheezing bilaterally and crackles at both bases. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1S2 , did have an S4 and did have a 3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex to the axilla. 
She also had a 1/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left upper sternal border. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with good bowel sounds. 
Sodium 146 , potassium 3.6 , chloride 117 , bicarb 19 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 120 , CK 76 , troponin 0 , CBC showed a white count of 8.73 , hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. 
Her baseline had been 30-38 on the last admission. 
ESR was 75 which is what it had been in July . 
INR was 3.1 Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular redistribution. 
Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. 
She did have left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. 
Her last echo done at LMC on 10/13/01 showed an ejection fraction of 63% , concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic function preserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened , mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderately increased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrial enlargement and they made notes that the mitral regurgitation was increased on this echo when compared with an echo done one year prior at LMC . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Breast cancer status post left mastectomy with lymph node dissection in 5/1 Pathology revealed invasive ductal carcinoma , grade 3/3 , node negative. 
3. History of rheumatic heart disease. 
4. History of hypertension. 
5. History of asthma diagnosed three years ago. 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lisinopril 40 q.d.; prednisone 10 q.d.; Coumadin 5 q.d.; Prevacid 30 q.d.; chloroquine 100 q.d.; Plaquenil 200 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 q.d.; albuterol inhaler p.r.n.; Flovent 220 2-3 puffs b.i.d.; Flonase b.i.d.; propafenone 150 t.i.d. 
ALLERGIES: Tetracycline which give her nausea and vomiting and sometimes she got that with aspirin. 
Tobacco history she does smoke 1 pack per day since she was 23. 
No ethanol. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: From an ischemia standpoint she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
We did continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril 40 q.d. 
From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral regurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history of increasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and increasing orthopnea. 
Thus , we got a repeat echo which showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejection fraction of 55% , normal RV. 
The mitral valve was moderately thickened and rheumatic in appearance. 
The mitral valve area was estimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an under estimate. 
The aortic valve was calcified. 
There was mild aortic insufficiency. 
There was mild tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus right atrial pressure. 
Then we proceeded to cardiac catheterization. 
She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IV Lasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterload reduction. 
Consultation with Dr. Suyama of cardiothoracic surgery was obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly from an MVR. 
Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged home and then to be readmitted electively when Dr. Suyama returned from vacation for an MVR. 
From a rate and rhythm standpoint , the patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital stay. 
We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history of atrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control on this. 
She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stay and thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did not have any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not need pacemaker placement on this admission. 
2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she had cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of breath was nearly 100% improved. 
3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was in good control. 
She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptoms such as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her on her Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone. 
4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of her lupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughout her stay. 
5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within her baseline range of 29-38. 
Full iron studies were sent and it was felt that it was most likely consistent with anemia of chronic disease. 
6 ) Prophylaxis: From a prophylaxis standpoint she was on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation so was not considered for heparin and she was continued on Prilosec throughout her stay. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; lisinopril 40 mg p.o.q.d.; magnesium gluconate 2 grams p.o. b.i.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. a.m.; propafenone 225 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.; K-Dur 60 mEq p.o.q.d.; Flovent 220 mg inhaled b.i.d.; Flonase 2 sprays nasally q.d. for her allergies and postnasal drip; Prevacid 30 mg p.o.q.d.; chloroquine 100 mg p.o.q.d.; Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
FOLLOWUP: She had an appointment to follow up with Dr. Bernas in one week's time and to follow up with Dr. Suyama in two weeks' time when he returned from vacation.

A non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in 2000 , status post percutaneous coronary intervention with right coronary artery stenting with 5 drug-eluting stents. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a CABG in 1995 and a non-ST elevation MI in 2000 , also with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy , status post a biventricular pacer and ICD placed in 2003 , who presents with hypertension to the Kernan To Dautedi University Of Of ED with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s on home monitor and also lightheadedness , fatigue , malaise for 2 days prior to the date of admission on February , 2005. 
She reports taking poor p.o. over the last 2 days prior to admission and stopping her home dose of Imdur and labetalol , but continued to take the torsemide and spironolactone. 
She was , therefore , for hypertension and acute and chronic renal failure. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She reports being fatigued , but denies chest pain or shortness of breath. 
She also reports lightheadedness , but no rotational dizziness. 
Furthermore , she describes having a mild headache and increased urinary frequency , but denies dysuria or hematuria. 
Tylenol 325 mg daily. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies consumption of alcohol and has no history of tobacco or injection drug use. 
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient was in no acute distress. 
Pulmonary: Showed no wheezes , rhonchi , or crackles , and a clear exam to auscultation in both lung fields. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. No murmur , rub , or gallop was appreciated. 
She was nontender and nondistended , obese , but no suprapubic tenderness. 
No hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities: There is no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema appreciated. 
Glucose was 88. Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: 1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor renal perfusion. 
However , her spironolactone continued to be held. 
As such , the patient was started on home dose of beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. 
It was felt that the patient was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the 130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. 
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin doses for known coronary artery disease. 
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. 
There were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes , which were excessive , currently negative. 
She had no further chest pain events. 
She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o. daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT at 2.8. 
The patient had no complications or events from her rhythm or rate standpoint. 
It was felt that her acute and chronic renal failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to admission and subsequent hypovolemia. 
The patient had no further issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive hydration , taking good p.o. On November , 2005 , the patient developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder , identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the past year and by ultrasound in 2004. 
However , given the dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone protocol was obtained on November , 2005 , which showed no evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. 
The patient responded well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of her symptoms by August , 2005 , hospital day #3. 5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by August , 2005. 
and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. 
The patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital course. 
As such , the diabetes service after consultation recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m. and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. 
She will follow up with her endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c. 7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss secondary to diureses. 
She remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal limits over her hospital admission. 
As such , no further therapy was required. 
To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well as her Synthroid regimen.

RECORD #1068
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 63 year old female with hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , who presents two days status post a syncopal episode in the setting of chest pain. 
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , postmenopausal , and she has no family history of coronary artery disease , and denies the use of tobacco. 
She underwent a cardiac catheterization in January of 1992 notable for 75% OM2 lesion , 50% ostial right RCA lesion , and ejection fraction at the time was 75%. 
She was stopped secondary to chest pain , she had some T wave inversions in the inferolateral leads felt to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
She also had an echocardiogram performed in August of 1994 with an ejection fraction of 60-65% , no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
She reports that on awakening she had no confusion. 
She denies any stool incontinence , no seizure activity per observers. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable for coronary artery disease , as above. 
Positive for diabetes mellitus in her mother and her daughter. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Clavea alone , no pets. 
She denies any use of tobacco or denies any use of alcohol. 
In general , obese black female in no apparent distress. 
HEENT examination was PERRL , EOMI , neck supple , full range of motion , she had a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and 2+ pulses bilaterally. 
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender , nondistended. 
Extremities showed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 
A chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates. 
She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 7/28/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid RCA , 90% stenosis at the origin of the PDA , 30% mid LAD , and 50% OM2. 
Further workup was performed including carotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis in either of the carotid arteries. 
She was noted to have 2+ mitral regurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and had no reported regional wall motion abnormality. 
She also had no arrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. 
The EPS Service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the RCA probably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes with possible bradycardia during ischemic episodes.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure. 
OTHER ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS: 1. Congestive heart failure , EF of 33% , etiology unknown. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old female with history of congestive heart failure in the past with an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% in October of 2003 , who presented with bilateral lower extremity edema as well as increasing shortness of breath. 
The patient reports that she has not been taking her Lasix as she was prescribed due to the inconvenience of going to the bathroom frequently. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 55% to 60% in October of 2003. 
8. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of 3-packs-per-day smoking for 30 years and no alcohol. 
This is an obese female in no apparent distress , sitting up in bed. 
Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and nondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Neurologically , euthymic without focal deficits. 
EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 , axis of -36 and no acute changes. 
ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history of congestive heart failure who presented with likely congestive heart failure exacerbation. 
She was ruled out for an MI with negative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-dose short-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). 
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workup with cardiac catheterization. 
She remained asymptomatic with the runs of NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. 
Given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejection fraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilated cardiomyopathy was begun. 
The patient did not wish for further investigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. 
Her other labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal , an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show iron overload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of this dictation. 
The patient will require close followup with careful fluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestive heart failure service. 
There was initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution of symptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive of pulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiral chest CT. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed. 
Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for her known diabetes. 
Avandia was held given it contraindication in heart failure. 
Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well as arthritis. 
Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitioned to Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may be more effected for her arthritis. 
Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression. 
FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestive heart failure service as well as her primary care physician.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56 year old black female with coronary artery disease , status post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery bypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into the hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a racing heart. 
She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her LIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to her obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. 
The coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable since that time without angina or congestive heart failure symptoms. 
During this episode , her back pain did not change in quality or intensity. 
She had no chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness , trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. 
She has had hypertension for ten years. 
She was not orthostatic. 
There were no rashes or bleeding. 
The neck was supple , positive jugular venous distention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. 
The back was without costovertebral angle tenderness or spinal tenderness. 
Pulses: Femoral on the left with a bruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. 
The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction with normal CK's. 
Her chest x-ray showed a globular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post coronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. 
She had right atrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no evidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. 
No pulmonary edema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. 
The patient had no acute changes. 
In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive regimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. 
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
An exercise stress test showed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains. 
It was reportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall , 2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no tumor or thrombus was detected. 
During her stay here , we were not able to get hold of him and notify him of the patient's status.

The chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. 
Her weight had been stable with no change in diet. 
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine. 
She was in atrial fibrillation with a irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive. 
She was kept on hydralazine , Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to bradycardia during this admission. 
She developed bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of digoxin. 
Her beta-blocker was stopped and then restarted at a lower dose. 
Although it dropped initially , it did not drop further during the hospital stay.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 69-year-old woman with diabetes , hypertension , congestive heart failure , rheumatologic overlap syndrome with rheumatoid arthritis/dermatomyositis , who was admitted for chest wall pain. 
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes complicated by neuropathy. 
There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
There was no significant pericardial effusion. 
2. Transesophageal echocardiogram performed on May , 2006 revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness with no regional wall motion abnormalities , trace mitral regurgitation was seen. 
There was no evidence of valvular vegetations or abscesses. 
3. A CT scan of the chest without contrast on August , 2006 showed a slight soft tissue prominence at the costosternal joint , but no abscess and no bone destruction was seen. 
There was no drainable fluid collection or bone destruction seen on the scan. 
Hematoma is also possible. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient had a negative rule out myocardial infarction protocol. 
She was maintained on her antihypertensive medications during her hospitalization and she was hemodynamically well controlled. 
Because the patient had MRSA bacteremia upon admission and because the patient had elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a possible diagnosis. 
TTE and TEE , however , showed no vegetations on the patient's valves. 
At the time of this dictation , the patient had negative blood cultures from September , 2006 through March , 2006. 
It was not obvious initially what the source was of the patient's MRSA bacteremia. 
However , both TTE and TEE showed no evidence of vegetations on the valves. 
The original CT scan showed a soft tissue prominence but no fluid collection. 
However , the Thoracic Surgery Service was consulted for possible debridement of the wound. 
The patient's dose of Synthroid was not altered. 
There was no evidence of infection. 
Creatinine will likely resolve with time without gentamicin administration in the future. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
Overlying the skin there was no erythema or warmth.

She came into the Emergency Room and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. 
The patient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on her Atenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure and resolution of her symptoms. 
MEDICATIONS: 1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d. 2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. 3. Aspirin 325 mg q d. 4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d. 5. Colace. 
She does not smoke or drink alcohol. 
GENERAL: The patient was a pleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during her history. 
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. 
CBC and coags were normal. 
Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette with mild evidence of CHF. 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST or T wave changes. 
She had no further episodes of her discomfort but did have continued belching. 
On further discussion with the patient , she was actually a relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms in the past and never described any shortness of breath , PND or orthopnea. 
The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do an adenosine stress test. 
Her adenosine stress test was negative for chest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixed reversible defects. 
However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did have a mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significance and unknown etiology. 
The patient was discharged in stable condition with no adverse drug reactions.

He had an echocardiogram on that day at Bussadd Southrys Community Hospital which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no regional wall motion abnormality and was otherwise normal. 
He "felt sick" but denied vomiting or diaphoresis. 
At baseline , the patient does little exercise secondary to his cerebral palsy , he has three-pillow orthopnea but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and he has no prior episodes of chest pain except as described above. 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes no medications. 
ALLERGIES: He has no allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke tobacco , he does not drink alcohol , and he does not use intravenous drugs. 
He was an obese black man in no acute distress. 
HEENT: The oropharynx was clear , there was no jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ and equal , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation , and the neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. 
The fundi were not well seen secondary to poor cooperation. 
ABDOMEN: Obese with positive bowel sounds , it was non-tender , slightly tympanitic , there was no hepatosplenomegaly , and the patient was guaiac negative. 
EXTREMITIES: Examination revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 
There was no focal tenderness and pulses were intact bilaterally. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor and given his rather indistinct complaints , a broad-based work-up was initiated including a rule out for myocardial infarction. 
There was concern given the pleuritic nature of his chest pain that the patient may have suffered a pulmonary embolism. 
The patient was kept on cardiac monitor until his rule out for myocardial infarction was complete. 
On the second hospital day , the patient became aware of the fact that his mother had been admitted to an outside hospital for a rule out myocardial infarction. 
On the fourth hospital day , it was felt that the patient was not suffering from any serious illness and that the most dangerous entities had been ruled out. 
His blood pressure was controlled with a beta blocker and he was discharged in stable condition to home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 year old white female with a history of coronary artery disease status post bypass in l988 who presented with atypical chest pain consistent with unstable angina for rule out myocardial infarction. 
She does not have diabetes mellitus or increased cholesterol. 
In l988 , she had three vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to her left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her OMB2 and right coronary artery. 
The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer disease diagnosed with melena in 3/10 and had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. 
In 11/23 , she had a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history of chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and an MCV of 68. Patient was treated with H2 blockers and iron but stopped secondary to constipation. 
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and the patient was discharged home for colonoscopy with Small Bowel Follow-Through that was never done. 
She also noted several episodes at rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. 
The patient presented to CHH with a thirty minute history of substernal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingual Nitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mild shortness of breath. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease as above , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiency anemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history of chronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past. 
NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm with a positive S4. 
There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
She had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits. 
ABDOMEN: Showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , and non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. 
EXTREMITIES: Showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses without bruits. 
She had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 
RECTAL: Showed normal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. 
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focal and within normal limits. 
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 with a white count of 6.9 and an MCV of 63. 
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees , intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a Q wave in III , and T wave inversions in III , V3 , and Vl-V4. 
These were all unchanged from her previous EKG from 5/6 HOSPITAL COURSE: Remarkable only for a rule out myocardial infarction in which she had serial CK and EKG that were completely within normal limits. 
Her CK were l54 , 482 , and 592 with normal MB fractions most consistent with either a very small myocardial infarction or , more likely , CK leak from some other source. 
Patient had several episodes of atypical chest pain after being moved down to the floor and EKG were completely within normal limits without any evidence of acute changes. 
On July , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had an exercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. 
Her peak heart rate was 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocal premature ventricular contractions with her exercise. 
She had non-specific ST and T wave changes only without evidence for ischemia. 
Of note , the patient is not an CHH patient and has no primary doctor. 
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Exercise tolerance test as above and blood products received were none.

RECORD #1161
In September of 1994 she had an abdominal hernia repair and had recurrent DVT by LENIs but was not treated. 
She reported that since 7/25 she started having right anterior chest pain with chest wall pain which was increased with deep ventilation , no cough. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is as above and also includes obesity and osteoarthritis of the knees. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was obese black female. 
HEENT: Unremarkable other than obesity and a sick sounding voice. 
Cardiac Exam: Regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur over the left sternal border , no S3 , no S4. Abdomen: Obese , soft , non-tender. 
EXTREMITIES: Left lower extremity was tender in the calf but not warm , no erythematous. 
Chest x-ray showed no acute infiltrate. 
LENIs showed no right DVT , a left greater saphenous vein superficial venous thrombosis , no change compared with 10/16/95. 
Her hypoxia seemed related more to her sleep apnea. 
She had no infiltrate on chest x-ray and was not treated for bronchitis either. 
DISPOSITION: She was therefore discharged in stable condition to follow up with Dr. Brady in Clinic as well as the Sleep Study Lab recommended that she follow up with ENT to see if any surgical options were available to her in correcting her sleep apnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. 
The patient first went to Forestblan Conwake Hospital ER then left AMA without further treatment after waiting four hours. 
Also there is a questionable increase in abdominal distention. 
The patient denies chest pain , fevers , sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80 beats per minute. 
Carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruits. 
There were no thyromegaly and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion. 
The abdominal exam was notable for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile palpable liver edge. 
There was no tenderness to palpation. 
He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout the stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later discontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of NSVT that he had possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. 
He understood that he was not likely to live long with the severity of his heart failure. 
In terms of ischemia , the first set of enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active issue. 
The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics , putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. 
This has been discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration given the degree of his heart failure. 
Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating his food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVP was about 10 cm. 
His abdomen was somewhat decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed. 
Extremities were warm without edema.

PULMONARY EMBOLUS 2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness of breath and left pleural effusion. 
Subsequently she had done quite well until February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and left-sided heart failure. 
Since that time the patient has had no improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which remains productive of white sputum with occasional "specks of red" and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. 
She is now unable to go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea. 
This is a significant change from approximately one month ago where she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. 
She denies any fever , chills , sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. 
She does not anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without children. 
The patient is alert , responsive , febrile and in no acute distress. 
She has no lymphadenopathy. 
Abdomen is soft and non-tender , slightly distended. 
EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation , normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no significant change compared with 7/24/94. 
This clinical picture was felt to be mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. 
As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that a chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. 
Given the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically for a pulmonary embolus. 
She was thus started on IV Heparin with achievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin without complications. 
Though the possibility that the wedge shaped opacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than infarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone , and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to alter management.

LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: 1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with a history of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrial fibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , on amiodarone until January 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skin discoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since a stent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations for cardiac-related issues. 
In July 2006 , he notes that he began to feel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasional palpitations , although he denied any chest pain. 
He was admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation and for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. 
He does not smoke. 
He does not drink excessively. 
Generally , this is a comfortable-at-rest-appearing gentleman in no respiratory distress. 
His abdomen is obese , mildly tender without hepatosplenomegaly. 
Chest x-ray , 10/27/2006 , shows cardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions. 
On presentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart failure , with a creatinine of 1.6. 
There were no symptoms or signs consistent with ischemia in-house. 
The patient was continued on aspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia. 
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on Toprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to pursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had previously experienced ).

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ): The patient was admitted to PUO on 5/25/06. 
A head CT showed no new lesions but did show multiple infarcts that were known to be old. 
This clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped. 
Around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderline hypertension for an unclear reason. 
The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker were held. 
The patient does not have any history of an arrhythmia. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is significant for:; 1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valve replacement in 1999. 
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION: The patient's medications prior to admission included: 1. Lasix 20 mg daily. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was not known to be a smoker or to use alcohol. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: On admission on 10/20/06 , the patient's vital signs were temperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratory rate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. 
He was not in any acute distress. 
There was no lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no extra sounds or murmurs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Phanco is a 72 year old man who is status post a coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement who presents with recurrent unstable angina. 
He was admitted to the Cardiology Service for cardiac catheterization. 
In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction and in October of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft with mitral valve replacement. 
He did fairly well with no recurrent symptoms until September of l989 when he presented with congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization at Pagham University Of which revealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and patent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. 
The patient was referred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronary artery bypass grafting was elected. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant moderately obese male in no acute distress. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: On July , patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and a left internal mammary artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. 
Post-operatively , the patient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with several episodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not felt to be significant enough to warrant further investigation by the Cardiology Service. 
This was well tolerated without complication.

She had recurrent exertional angina one month later and a repeat catheterization at that time showed no change. 
She later had recurrent chest pain at rest and again went to cardiac catheterization which showed a 70% mid LAD lesion , 30% RCA , and a normal LV-gram with 75% ejection fraction. 
She has done well until two days prior to admission when she experienced recurrent angina at rest , and was admitted to Kendsonre Ale Ater Hospital where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
( 6 ) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
ALLERGIES: Compazine causes a possible dystonia. 
HEENT: There was no thyromegaly , no jugular venous distention. 
Carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. 
Abdomen: A midline scar was noted , otherwise soft , nontender , without hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities: 2+ bilateral femoral pulses , dorsalis pedis pulses , no edema. 
The PT was 13.1 , and the PTT was 57.3 ( possibly drawn off a line which had been hep-flushed ).

RECORD #1188
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year-old woman followed by Dr. Elleby in the KTDUOO Clinic for problems related to obesity , depression and poorly controlled hypertension. 
A mammogram at that time revealed mildly dense parenchyma and no calcium and an ultrasound revealed 4 mm hypoechoic nodule compatible duct obstruction with debris. 
She was seen by Dr. Foerschler in the Surgery Clinic and scheduled for a right breast biopsy , but because of persistent hypertension as an outpatient , she is now admitted for blood pressure control prior to the breast biopsy on August , 1995. 
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies. 
She has a 40 pack year history of smoking and denies alcohol abuse. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese woman in no apparent distress. 
She has no lymphadenopathy and no bruits. 
Her abdomen is obese with a midline scar , positive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Her extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and she has diminished peripheral pulses. 
LABORATORY: On admission , her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes , unchanged from EKG in September of 1992. 
The right breast abscess was drained without incident. 
Other notable events in the hospital included a Psychiatry consult who suggested that the patient had a history of major depression and recommended ruling organic brain disease. 
A polysonography was done for monitoring of sleep apnea and an MMTI for further diagnostic evaluation.

RECORD #1189
His first presentation with coronary disease was in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100% occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty of the circ to a 70% residual. 
He had a negative hypercoagulative workup after this. 
In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no additional myocardial infarctions. 
He denies associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. 
The patient denies orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. 
He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. 
EKG showed no acute changes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs with pulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of an INR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. 
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male , well appearing and in no acute distress. 
There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy. 
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , without wheezes or rales. 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. 
There is no rebound or guarding. 
Extremities are warm and well perfused , with no edema. 
On 10/21 he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal LAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right PDA. 
He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that had been angioplastied during cath. 
Recath was thought to be low yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the interventional Cardiology Service. 
His medical regimen was maximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates. 
The test was considered consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. 
He will see his primary care physician , Dr. Mccants , for monitoring of his other medical issues , including his diabetes. 
Discharge condition is stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one tab sublingual a.q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , ramipril 5 mg p.o. q. day , Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day x 70 days , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day x 25 days ( a total of 30 days since the stent ) , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Avandia 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.

The patient does not recall having fevers at home , however , notes that he "get fevers all the time" so he feels that he may not have noticed. 
He did report that he had a temperature to about 101 and hemodialysis prior to admission for which he received one dose of vancomycin. 
He denied having any symptoms of headache , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , joint aches or rash. 
He has had numerous admissions to PMH in the past year for treatment of the foot for which he received several courses of antibiotics. 
At this time , he had extensive evaluation including an MRI of the foot and it was felt that there was no evidence of osteomyelitis. 
He remained in the nursing home from 1/18 through 5/22 and was discharged home two weeks prior to admission. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Diabetes since the age of 23 , unclear if it is type 1 or type 2. The patient reports that he has a history of type 1 diabetes , but also reports that he had been without insulin for three years after diagnosis.

His surgical pathology returned with clean margins on day of discharge , and as per ID consult service , he does not need further antibiotics. 
Abo was on the renal service and had hemodialysis 3 times a week ( M/W/F ) without complication. 
We obtained his hospital records from PMH and a vascular study from 9/19 showed evidence of a DVT in the L internal jugular vein from 5/5 The details surrounding this DVT are not documented , however Mr. Abo reports that his vascular surgeon told him that he should remain on Coumadin. 
He was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduce perioperative MI risk prior to his surgery. 
He reported that he is not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and his doctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure and history of atrial flutter in September of 1998. 
The patient was admitted to Cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter and worsening congestive heart failure. 
Chest x-ray at that time showed congestive heart failure. 
The patient did extremely well after discharge until about five days ago when he ran out of his Atenolol , which he had not taken since then. 
Today , the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few seconds of chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. 
The patient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms. 
Upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short of breath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness. 
There was no warning or dizziness. 
There , the patient was noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. 
The patient denied any fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history was significant for high blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis , questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis , diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in September of 1998. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
There was no history of drug use. 
In general , the patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. 
The neck was supple without bruits. 
There was no clubbing or cyanosis. 
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion , consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleural effusions. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology floor for treatment of atrial flutter and congestive heart failure. 
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
It was felt that the patient's worsening congestive heart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. 
The patient was started on Lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker. 
Of note , also , the patient's ventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistent with possible infiltrative disease. 
On 14 of October , the patient underwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still in atrial flutter and was not having good rate control. 
However , the patient underwent a VQ scan and was ruled out for pulmonary embolism.

DOCIMO MD , PHD ATTENDING: Rossie Mankoski , M.D. ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Non-ST elevation MI. OTHER DIAGNOSIS: Thromboembolic coronary artery occlusion , rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve replacement , aortic valve replacement with St. Jude's valve , status post tricuspid repair , CHF , type II diabetes , atrial fibrillation , esophageal ulcer , osteoporosis. 
In brief , Ms. Wolsey is a 63-year-old Hindi speaking woman with CAD , rheumatic heart disease , status post mitral valve replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , diabetes type II , history of subacute bacterial endocarditis transferred from Norap Valley Hospital with a troponin of 64. 
There was a question of dig effect. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD , rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve replacement , aortic valve replacement , A. fib , SBE , diabetes. 
The patient had had a negative catheterization just two years ago and it was unclear whether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronary artery disease or from another source such as pericarditis or erosion from endocarditis into her myocardium. 
Also , given the back pain , there was a concern for aortic dissection and a chest CT was done on 8/4/04 which showed no aortic dissection. 
She was continued on heparin , Plavix , aspirin , and beta-blocker and will be restarted on her ACE inhibitor , was not restarted in hospital , by her PCP. 
She again had neck pain in V2 through V5 depressions on 6/17 , just three days after the catheterization on 3/25 This was medically managed because the dynamic changes did not return and thought to be left over plaque from the last lesion. 
The patient had been stable for about one week before discharge without any complaints of neck pain whatsoever and her troponins had trended down significantly during this event. 
The patient had not complained of any symptoms while walking. 
Her old RVSP increased roughly to 65 , possible increase in mitral gradient. 
Possible increase in mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough to evaluate given her artificial valve. 
Respiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumed pneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. 
She was doing well , but given her continued pain , GI and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesenteric ischemia. 
We held off on starting the ACE because of this , but she should consider getting an ACE to add to her regimen given her diabetes and recent MI. 
Endocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. 
I also recommended that patient not add salt to her diet and not drink fluids greater than one liter per day and also check her daily weights.

Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranial nerves grossly intact , no abnormalities. 
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension and infectious etiology. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid colon. 
Given history of C. diff colitis , C. diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were possible. 
Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low forward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejection fraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory colitis or nonspecific colitis. 
Stool samples were sent for a C. diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples. 
Stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during admission. 
The flex sig did not change his management. 
Patient had no evidence for acute coronary syndrome on admission. 
We continued his aspirin , Plavix , statin and beta-blocker. 
Patient had no ischemic issues or coronary artery disease issues during his admission. 
Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so a gentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertension and then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able to restart patient's Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra fluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. 
Also considered restarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient follow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril , once patient is fully recovered. 
The patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during admission. 
He did not have any renal issues. 
Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , has been treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how along patient should be treated , given that the DVT was line induced.

The patient has had severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. 
He underwent a 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts to the LVB , D1 and first obtuse marginal on 19 of October His postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection , with debridement performed on 15 of May He was put on vancomycin and sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin. 
The patient denied dysuria. 
He was able to ambulate and play golf prior to the coronary artery bypass grafting in October . 
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiovascular examination showed JVP approximately 8 centimeters , carotids were I+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , very distant heart sounds. 
Back showed no costovertebral angle tenderness. 
Chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobe infiltrate with possible effusion. 
After his temperature spike on 21 of August , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of the following days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. 
The sternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued on vancomycin for the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that grew from the wound site on 15 of May The patient had a computerized tomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternal wound site and no abscess was seen. 
Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria and fungal growth. 
Gram stain showed no organisms , no polymorphonuclear cells. 
All cultures from this hospitalization are negative to date. 
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction. 
The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive heart failure. 
He was not orthostatic on the day prior to discharge. 
Urine eosinophils were not present. 
More likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to decrease his congestive heart failure. 
The patient has a history of depression and may benefit from counseling. 
The patient's decreased oral intake , nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying depressive component over his prolonged illness. 
He has not required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has been discontinued for 2 days.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous stasis , postherpetic neuralgia , atrial fibrillation , and urinary tract infection. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker placement , and chronic venous stasis who presents with nausea , vomiting , and failure to thrive. 
The patient was recently admitted to Pagham University Of in early October with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lower extremity cellulitis. 
She also states that she has had no bowel movement for a week prior to admission. 
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure , hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous stasis , T6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zoster with postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear , atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history of guaiac-positive stools. 
Neck is otherwise supple with no tenderness to palpation. 
There is an area of erythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence of infected ulceration. 
The patient did not feel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , but her strength was symmetric throughout. 
The patient was continued on her beta-blocker. 
No aspirin was given , as the patient is on Coumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool. 
Her last echo showed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction , mild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrial pressure ). 
Initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was held given dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her admission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a slightly negative fluid balance. 
The patient was also continued on her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequately hydrated for blood pressure control. 
She is on Coumadin with her INR at goal. 2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky opacity of the right lung base possibly representing an infiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume. 
The patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung exam clear ). 3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior to admission with decreased p.o. intake. 
She also reported no bowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. 
A KUB was obtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or free air. 
The patient was given stool softeners and laxatives p.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. 
She was continued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
There is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was thought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications , which were increased early on in her hospitalization to address her postherpetic neuralgia. 
This study showed no aspiration and normal passage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was made of cricopharyngeal prominence ). 
Abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in October 2005 showed gallstones , but no other process to explain the abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. 
The patient had no right upper quadrant pain on this admission. 
4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenous fluids for dehydration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in LVH , recently discharged from I Warho Hospital on 7/10 and subsequently transferred to Bussadd Southrys Community Hospital The patient presents with increased shortness of breath. 
The prior admission was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no dictated summary available ). 
The patient without palpitation. 
The patient also notes noted increased hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for over 1-2 years per patient. 
The patient denies chest pain. 
Labs were notable for elevated BNP of 655 , elevated ammonia of 83. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Morbid obesity. 
3. Chronic hyper ammonium levels NH3 ranging from 70 to 90 ( prior workup largely negative however never able to image the abdomen secondary to severe obesity ). 4. History of normal LFTs in the past. 
History of multiple myeloma , monoclonal gammopathy status post Cytoxan. 
MEDICATIONS: 1. Sotalol 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Klonopin. 
General: Morbidly obese , speaking in full sentences. 
No lymphadenopathy. 
Cardiovascular: RRR , no MRG , no S3 or S4 appreciated. 
Abdomen: Obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave. 
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2 26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) , albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of 137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). 
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. 
EKG first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular?? vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. 
Of note , renal ultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )I revealed no hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive MIBI in 10/10 The patient with no EKG changes , and also no chest pain. 
The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta blocker and a statin. 
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. 
Chest x-ray as described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly improved from before ). 
Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 At time of discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 
Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without alarms. 
The patient does use BiPAP at night for obstructive sleep apnea. 
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding scale and a.m. 
No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the significantly elevated creatinine. 
secondary to elevated sugars ( resulting in more improved glycemic control ). 4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). 
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large habitus. 
Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ). 
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal LFTs. 
This has also been worked up in the past according to the patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. 
The patient is too obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. 
The patient does have a history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated ammonia , versus a hepatic source. 
The patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse. 
Hematocrit was stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion. 
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. 
The oncologist attending , Dr. Malachi , who knows the patient felt there was no need for additional chemo at this time. 
Previous Cytoxan therapy has not been significantly effective. 
A neurology consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities , this is not likely secondary to a myositis. 
No further workup was performed. 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Tylenol 325 p.o. q.6h p.r.n. pain.

GENERAL: This is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman in no acute distress. 
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , obese. 
EXTREMITIES: Warm , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. 
He was diuresing two liters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. 
He has continued to be diuresed with torsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. 
He should be at or near euvolemia on 11/10/02 and he was discharged on a diuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. 
Ischemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital admission. 
No evidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. 
No further workup was pursued from a rhythm standpoint. 2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. 
When he was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Thode , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and titrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and there was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would precipitate angina. 
Endocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg p.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25 mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly titrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina. 
The patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes maintained on insulin. 
His insulin doses had been titrated downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low fingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while in the hospital. 
He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards by his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Colella 3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and during this admission he was maintained on his outpatient medications of Prozac and Restoril. 
without any notable side effects.

The patient's cardiac risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , and post-menopausal. 
A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate to severe proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal 1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and a tight left circumflex. 
She was admitted in July of 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction. 
It had no radiation and no nausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. 
She had no relief with three sublingual nitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room. 
The patient's admission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes from her previous ECG. 
During the first several days of admission the patient began complaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning , the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right back and she was tender to palpation. 
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 5/26/97. 
Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , the catheterization showed three vessel disease with normal left ventricular function. 
It was felt that the patient needed to go for coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she had the herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait to do the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved. 
Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergo coronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. 
There were no complications.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year-old male whose past medical history is significant for myocardial infarction in 1996 without residual angina , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and a recent diagnosis of sleep apnea. 
One day prior to admission , he went to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and given Erythromycin and Ciprofloxacin without improvement. 
The following day , he went back to his primary care provider and was given cough syrup with Codeine , but without relief and through the course of that day , he developed increasing shortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented to the emergency room. 
His cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs. 
His extremities revealed no edema. 
His neurological examination was non-focal. 
There were no ischemic changes. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea who was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failed outpatient management. 
He was cultured and sputums were obtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout his hospital course. 
However , at this time , the possibility of flash pulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. 
However , it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant for an episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure was at baseline. 
His heart rate was at 70 and he had not become obviously fluid overloaded. 
Nonetheless , he received a cardiac work-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for a myocardial infarction and the following day , he received an echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% with apical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis.

2. Morbid obesity. 
Left leg amputation status post a diabetic ulcer. 
17. Chronic venous stasis ulcers. 
The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. 
Right leg was fully intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no palpable pulses. 
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was negative. 
He had a right heart catheterization which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. 
He is now being restarted on Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3. 2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and his underlying COPD and body habitus. 
This suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. 
At this point , he will be sent home on home BiPAP. 3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted. 
They were initially concerned that there could have been a superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin was discontinued after two days. 
This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. 
Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point. 
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which is well controlled after his recent weight loss. 
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. 
The patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.

IDENTIFICATION DATA: This patient is a 59-year-old white female with known coronary artery disease , past history of myocardial infarction admitted 4/9/91 with three weeks of worsening dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient's coronary risk factors include hypertension , elevated cholesterol , 25-pack-year smoking history and a positive family history. 
The patient was transferred to Pagham University Of where a cardiac catheterization was performed which showed an 80% proximal LAD lesion and a 30% mid RCA lesion. 
The angioplasty procedure was not done. 
In April of 1988 , the patient had an echocardiogram which showed significant LVH , decreased LV compliance , borderline left atrial enlargement and no regional wall motion abnormalities. 
The patient was treated for presumed asthma with Bronkosol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol. 
On 7/14 , the patient while walking at the Scot Re became acutely short of breath with 2/10 substernal chest pressure radiating to the right arm without nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis or lightheadedness. 
Type II hyperlipidemia. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an obese white female in no apparent distress.

JVP was not appreciated. 
Carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. 
Abdomen was obese , well healed old surgical scars , soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. 
EKG while pain free , showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 , axis of 40 degrees , intervals 0.21/0.10/0.36 and flat T waves in I and L. Chest x-ray showed a question infiltrate in the left base consistent with atelectasis. 
EKG showed only T wave flattening in I and L. The patient was admitted for presumed asthma and bronchitis and treated with Bronkosol nebulizers. 
On hospital day number two , the patient went for echocardiogram which was not obtained because the patient had developed 5/10 substernal chest pressure which resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. 
There were no EKG changes , the patient was started on heparin with question of unstable angina at that time. 
On hospital day number three , the patient went for cardiac catheterization which showed serial 40 and 50% lesions in the LAD and also an 80% lesion in the distal RCA. 
There were no complications post catheterization. 
It was questionable whether these lesions were serious enough to account for the patient's symptoms. 
The patient also had asymptomatic pyuria and bacteruria and was treated for a presumed urinary tract infection with three days of oral Bactrim.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 38-year-old female with a history of asthma , type II diabetes mellitus , obesity , depression , and iron deficiency anemia who presented to Pagham University Of on 3/9/06 complaining of worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness over the past three days after running out of her asthma medications approximately two weeks ago. 
She denied any fevers or chills , no nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain , or cough. 
She did report some increased lower extremity edema over the past several days and admits to not taking her Lasix. 
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. 
The patient was awake , alert and oriented x3 and in no apparent distress. 
Abdomen is obese , soft , nondistended , nontender. 
Chest x-ray showed a large cardiac silhouette with no evidence of effusion or infiltrate. 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 38-year-old female with asthma , diabetes , anemia , and morbid obesity who was admitted with his asthma exacerbation in the setting of running out of her medications at home. 
Because the patient had desaturations with ambulation , it was concerned that the patient possibly had an atypical pneumonia given these ground glass opacities. 
She had a BNP to rule out any evidence of volume overload that was contributing to her oxygen desaturations. 
It is highly suspected that the patient has a component of sleep apnea and she is to be set up for an outpatient sleep study. 
Pulmonary function tests were consistent with restrictive disease and this is likely due to patient's obesity. 
The patient most likely has obesity hypoventilation. 
The patient should be started on aspirin given her diabetes and her hypertension. 
There were no other pertinent findings on exam at discharge.
