ATTENDING: GENNY SALVADOR BARRETTE MD
ADDENDUM
This is an addendum to yesterday's dictation. The patient on
11/23/2005 had a hematocrit drawn that was 25. The patient was
asymptomatic , but given her risk factors for coronary artery
disease including diabetes and hypertension , we felt that
transfusing her 2 units prior to discharge will be appropriate.
She has received 2 units of blood on the evening of 11/23/2005
and was discharged on 1/1/2005 , felt that no repeat hematocrit
was necessary as she remained asymptomatic and stable. She will
be discharged on 1/1/2005 .
