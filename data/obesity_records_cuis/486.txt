Discharge Date: 10/2/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old gravida
5 , para 5 , with history of
postmenopausal bleeding and thickened endometrial stripe by
ultrasound. She had a history of breast cancer status post
lumpectomy , radiotherapy , and Tamoxifen therapy with the Tamoxifen
therapy ongoing over the past four years. She was evaluated and
Pipelle biopsy was unsuccessful and fractional dilation and
curettage revealed scant inactive endometrial tissue. This was in
January of 1994. She had a follow-up endometrial biopsy which showed
quantity not sufficient and there was no further follow-up. All of
this was done outside of our offices. She saw Dr. Fulco for
evaluation initially of an irregular cervix on her initial intake
into the Carna Home Hospital system and this history
was reviewed. She had always had normal Pap smears. Colposcopic
biopsy and endocervical curettage were all negative. She had not
at that point had postmenopausal bleeding for a couple of years.
Her uterus was felt to be overly enlarged and ultrasound showed a
1.9 cm irregular stripe. Pipelle was not possible , due perhaps to
stenosis of the internal os. Therefore she was brought for
fractional dilation and curettage and diagnostic hysteroscopy as an
inpatient because of her history of Coumadin therapy for chronic
atrial fibrillation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease with
mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation , as
well as aortic insufficiency and mild tricuspid insufficiency. She
has had a history of chronic congestive heart failure. Chronic
atrial fibrillation is noted. Breast cancer is noted. There is a
question of a pulmonary edema in 1993.
MEDICATIONS: Tamoxin , Coumadin , Furosemide , Inderal , Lanoxin , Kay
Ciel.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , erythromycin , and Isordil.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke and does not drink.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: Spontaneous vaginal deliveries times five.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Beyond the breast surgery , this included
appendectomy in 1994 , as well as fractional
dilation and curettage in 1994.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Basically unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was preadmitted for switch-over to
heparin therapy. The heparin was then stopped
four hours prior to her surgical procedure which occurred on
4/11/96 . The findings at hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage
included normal appearing endocervical canal , 7.5 cm cavity , and an
approximately 3 x 1 cm endometrial polyp. She had lush
endometrium. The ostia were not easily visualized. The procedure
was very smooth and done under MAC anesthesia with paracervical
block and she had a minimal blood loss. Postoperatively she did
quite well without fever or other problems. She was put back on
her Coumadin such that , on the day of discharge , her INR was
approaching 2.0. She was discharged with plans for follow-up as an
outpatient regarding her Coumadin therapy.
