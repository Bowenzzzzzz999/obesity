*****Assessment and Hospital Course*****
52 yo woman with increasing shortness of breath , weight gain in setting
of increasing fluid intake:
**CV: Pump: volume overload secondary to CHF , excessive fluid intake
likely secondary to new onset DM. Diuresed with 20mg lasix IV in ED ,
40mg IV lasix on floor , with resolution of orthopnea and DOE.
Maintained on verapamil for ventricular relaxation. Will see Dr.
Reedy as outpatient for potential ablation of HOCM. Seen by Dr.
Carri Katcsmorak genetic counselor to discuss genotyping of HOCM , for
herself and her children.
-Isch: low suspicion , ruled out by enzymes. Continued verapamil for
HTN.

**Pulm: PFTs notable for restrictive pattern--TLC 56% , FVC 59% , FEV1
