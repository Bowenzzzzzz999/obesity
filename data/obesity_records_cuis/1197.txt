HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Gueretta is a 45 year old gentle-
man with a long history of coronary
artery disease , the first admission to I Warho Hospital
due to myocardial infarction was October , 1988. Coronary
angiography in 1988 revealed three vessel coronary artery disease
with ejection fraction of 45%. The next hospitalization at I Warho Hospital in 1993 due to syncopal episode. Since the last
admission , Mr. Gueretta was doing well , essentially the same level
of symptoms. Objectively , however , there was evidence of
significant progression of coronary disease with Thallium images
suggestive of severe multivessel coronary artery disease and
developed LV dysfunction. Recent admission to I Warho Hospital for coronary artery catheterization and eventual
myocardial revascularization.
